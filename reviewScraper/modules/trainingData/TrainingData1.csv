My friend and I decided to take an impromptu Int/Adv ballet class after an audition. They had very nice staff and were helpful. I love the piano accompaniment. It brings be back to my youth. I would definitely recommend classes.,Ballet class surprise
"My wife and I were visiting our relatives in Brooklyn. They took us to Dance Fever Studios to do the Argentine tango. We were complete beginners, but loved it. This studio is a wonderful place. Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different to do when visiting Brooklyn. This also have salsa and ballroom dancing.",Argentine Tango Lessons in Brooklyn
"Dance Fever Studios taught me how to do the Argentine tango. Come to visit Brooklyn a few times a year, and every time we go we take a tango lesson here. Francis, our teacher, is great. Really knows how to break things down. We don't get this in Atlanta. The space is also amazing.",Taught me how to Argentine tango
"Best salsa lessons in Brooklyn. My girlfriend dragged me here, but now I love it. We tried a few other salsa schools, but the lessons were too fast and confusing. Here they really know how to break it down so even a non dancer can get it. We are regulars now.",Best Salsa Lessons in Brooklyn
I've always been afraid to take dance lessons since I've always felt like a klutz on the dance floor but my son told me about Dance Fever Studios because he began wedding choreography lessons there and is very impressed with the owner Fran(who also instructs). Well I decided to get up the nerve to attend their Saturday Night Dance Party and it was a lot of fun. I signed up for lessons and have really boosted my confidence. The woman who is teaching me now really puts me at ease and I look forward to every session. Just a great time and glad I took the leap.,Saturday Night Dance Party
"You won't find a better place to learn how to dance. The teachers are all friendly and know how to teach. They are also great dancers. They have lots of different classes. If you get tired of salsa, you can do tango. Both of their studios are great.",Love This Dance School.
"An amazing dance studio, with great instructors! My friend recommended Dance Reverie for dance classes for our wedding. We purchased a groupon and took a few group classes and one private class - and since then had purchased a 10 private classes. Firstly the price is very fair. The teachers are extremely professionals so you can feel very comfortable working with them. We have trained with different instructors and they are all amazing, patient and have taught us a great moves. We have another 3-4 classes and our dance already is coming along great. Not only are we learning how to move but we are also having an amazing time. I would highly recommend it!",Great Experience!
"It just doesn't happen often enough. I was very happy to see many of the Sandra Cameron alumni hot footing quickstep, American tango, and swaying boleros. Gene did a great job as DJ, actually getting a finale applause! So, if you are lucky enough to be in town for the next event drop on by...and wear those dancing shoes.",Ballroom dancing at the Y
"I have never given a bad review until now. I would not even given a 1 star but that was the minimum. I came to this club from the Philly are for a private event of ballroom dance. Tickets were purchased 2 months prior. It was an extremely hot and humid day. Arrived after 6 pm and told they would not open til 7pm. We went across the street to a sports bar restaurant to have a snack and water to stay cool. At 7pm we ventured back and a line had formed outside and were still not letting anyone in. I stood in front of a pizza shop which had its oven exhaust blowing on me on top of the extreme heat outside. I started to not feel well due to the heat. Finally at 7:25 they started letting the line in. By the time I managed the second set of stairs I collapsed from the heat. If it were not for my husband to go in search of water to help revive me I do not know what would have happened. The security thugs in the place were pushing me down the steps and wanted me to go outside back into the heat which caused the problem, as opposed to letting me sit in a chair at the top of the landing and recover. A scene ensued to remove me to the outside to walk around and come back. We went back to sports bar and an angel of a hostess saw that I looked piqued and offered to give me a huge cup of ice water which made me feel so much better. I really wanted to go ballroom dancing and we came a long way. We returned and found that we could not attend the event by the security thugs. We were told to leave. I thank God nothing serious happened for they would be held responsible. What a horrible establishment. I have never been treated as poorly as their security staff did and pushing me down the steps was uncalled for.",A night of DISGUST
"I've been to the Copa many times for salsa dancing. People have to understand this is a dance club. Don't expect any seating and services. Must check your coat and bag for $3.00, cannot bring your own water. There are lots of salsa dancers all different levels. You can bring your own dance partner or find one easily. The classes are very basic. Usually there are buffets early in the evening. If you get there early, the price is very reasonable (from free to $5.00 $10.00 depend on the activity). Best for group celebration. It's a great place to have fun!","Great spot for Salsa dancing, bring your dancing shoes"
"I went to enjoy the free salsa lesson. I didn't realize it so close to 5th avenue. It's a quiet park with lots of people sitting around. There was rush near the fountain where the salsa lesson took place at 6 pm. I enjoyed seeing the energy of the people dancing. It was a fun evening,
",Enjoyed walking around
"If you wanna dance and want to follow along or even try your hand at choreo dance but basic level or intense levels, it's all there. You don't have to be embarrassed of your moves, your size , you age, your attire, because no one judges anybody !
Full of all kinds of age groups ! I'm 42 and I love going and lose so much weight ! And made new friends AND found Zumba !",Great place to shake it
"The zumba classes at LADanceFit Studio far surpass any studio class that I have ever taken! I've taken classes in Los Angeles and surrounding cities, Ojai, San Diego, Las Vegas, and even in D.C. But, it's LA Dance Fit that has the most amazing and talented instructors!
The instructors actively engage their students with verbal and non-verbal cues. They truly share their love of dancing with their class and with their peers. The LA Dance Fit instructors teach fun, high-energy classes by putting their own creative spin on ordinary moves. These moves are further highlighted by the awesome choices of current ever-changing music as well as with oldies remixes. 
Other quality classes include HipHop (beg + adv) as well as cardio hip hop and salsa/Latin hip hop. New classes are always being added to give students an opportunity to try something new and different.
If you live in Los Angeles, are new to Los Angeles, or are just visiting here, LA Dance Fit Studio IS THE PLACE! to get a great workout, have fun, meet people, and truly enjoy yourself!",Best ZUMBA/HipHop Studio in LA!
"I have wanted to try these classes after a friend I saw salsa dance. She told me she took the classes here and it was for a bit and she learned to dance and she is like a professional, in my opinion. The classes seemed hard because I started in the boot camp Sunday and its very overwelming if you start like that. I decided to pay for the month of unlimited classes, only $50! I took the first class the next day and it is much easier they do beginner side and intermediate side so I learned with people just beginning too, I am excited to continue and learn!

The studio was beautiful, peaceful and clean. Phillip said that your class was awesome.",Phillip love the class and the studio
"I have been going to Move Studio for many years, and have taken different classes. The instructors are all very well qualified, and the staff is very helpful. It's a great place to go to try different exercise modalities. They have lots of drop in classes. That's great for trying out something new, or if only in town for a short while.
",Move Studio is great
"Move Studio offers a wide variety of classes. They have multiple studios with multiple classes at the same time. Each studio is very nice and private (you don't hear sounds from other classes going on at the same time). The teachers are top notch and fellow students are very welcoming. (P.S. This is the studio where Emmitt Smith trained when he was on Dancing with the Stars!)

",Great yoga studio

"I have been going to Move for three years and I find the staff friendly and the classes available are many and taught by experienced professionals. I joined a Health club recently where they offer classes as part of the membership, but I refuse to give up the classes at Move Studio. In fact I keep finding new and interesting classes to try. Love this studio. GA",Move Studio

I was hooked on Chogaflow from my first class! Valerie is a fantastic Yogi...patient and attentive to all the concerns of her class. Move Studio is wonderful...extremely helpful and attentive! I have only heard great stories about all of the classes offered at Move Studio.,Chogaflow and Move Studio
"I have been doing Chogaflow with Valerie Rogers at Move Studio twice weekly for over two years. To say this beautiful yoga practice has changed my life for the better is a real understatement.
Move Studio is the perfect place for this Chogaflow class.
It is a place which nurtures the idea of health and joy. Cell phones are turned off before entering the door, and the focus changes from the rush-rush of the outside world to a focus of creating inner strength and peace.
Whether for a drop-in class or a series, Move Studio is a beautiful, nurturing place I count on to help keep me centered and joyful.","So serene, friendly, and positive"
"I had the pleasure of taking a Chogaflow class from Valerie. I've been thinking about it ever since. Valerie is an outstanding teacher; she gives individual attention and help with each exercise movement. I felt relaxed and peaceful at the end of the class. It was a very positive experience as are all of the classes. I encourage you to visit Move Studio this summer and enjoy all of the benefits that they offer.
