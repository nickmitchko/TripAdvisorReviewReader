0,Conrad New York,"Beautiful, spacious, cold",47,, 50-64 year old male ,dpsaz,M,5600,0,20,"102 North End Avenue , New York City , NY 10282-1238 102 North End Avenue , New York City, NY 10282-1238",Arizona,https://www.tripadvisor.com//ShowUserReviews-g60763-d208452-r466100021-Conrad_New_York-New_York_City_New_York.html#CHECK_RATES_CONT,10/01/2016,03/10/17,"The Conrad is my favorite downtown hotel. It's situated west of the West Side Highway. Across from the World Financial Center and steps from WTC and The Memorial. On the block is Shake Shack and North End Grill for awesome eats. All accommodations are at least 2 room suites. Great shower. Nespresso coffee makers. Comfortable furnishings all around. Most views are ""city"" with Goldman Sachs facing east and other buildings (with a peek of the Hudson) facing west. Cool rooftop bar. I agree with another reviewer that in spite of the surroundings, the hotel leaves me kind of cold. Maybe it's the atrium structure or the formality of the staff. That's too bad, but not a deal breaker in my mind. I can survive the chill downstairs for a comfortable, well situated space upstairs.",Solo,26,4,NA,,0,0,10/08

The location is very downtown - across from World Trade Center and convenient to the offices in the area. The style of the hotel is very professional and sleek. Dark colors and geared towards a business clientele. I received an upgraded room with a great view of the Hudson. The room was uniquely laid out - nice living room area then small hall with bathroom leading to bedroom. The room was spotlessly clean, with very nice furnishings and amenities. Breakfast is downstairs in the lobby, and there's a pickup counter to take food to go (which was very convenient). I would definitely recommend this hotel for business stays. The location lends itself less to tourists or leisure due to its proximity to office buildings and distance from most sights (except the WTC). That said, most subway lines are nearby.",Solo,,5,"NY, USA",,0,1,01/08

And yet it leaves me kind of cold. I end up staying here because of the positives, but I never really *want* to stay here. It just doesn't feel luxurious or personal. There are no doormen greeting you. Breakfast is a hot mess express, with tons of people waiting at all times for a table. The buffet really lacks in variety for a supposedly 5 star hotel. There was a light bulb out in the room, as well as a non-working remote (the working one worked for both televisions). So it's a good shell of a hotel, and I will likely continue to stay here on short trips, but if I'm looking for anything special, I'd look elsewhere.",Solo,14,4,Massachusetts,,0,0,02/07

The room (i took a room with view of the Hudson River) was spacious and luxurious. There's absolutely nothing that i can complain about because i loved everything about it (it's more a suite than a room). From the comfortable & firm king bed, to the cosy living room area, to having 2 TVs, and separate toilet and shower areas, everything was just perfect. And the location's good too - close to downtown and financial district and the 911 Memorial Museum. Initially, i was worried that the area would be too quiet in the evening, but the area, though suitably quiet, was well lit and still had enough people on the streets till about 10pm to make a solo traveler feel safe enough. The hotel's also within a couple minutes walk to some shopping centres, so there's plenty of food choices. I only have 1 suggestion for the hotel to consider: to install a couple of hand bars in the shower area, just in case the floor's slippery. And possibly a phone or emergency button in the shower area, in case of emergencies. But otherwise, i absolutely loved my stay and would definitely stay there again if i return to NYC.",Solo,2,5,NA,,0,0,09/07

Its pricey, but so is everything in NYC. the staff at this hotel are on a par with Claridges, and although the public rooms, restaurant and bar aren't as good, that has more to do with space issues than anything else.the one downside is that the hotel is v close to Trump Tower so i was kept awake almost all night by the demonstrators against his future rule. Not the fault of the hotel of course, which will now become my regular joint when in the Big Apple. Bring a stuffed wallet though ; espresso is US 12!!",Solo,,4,NA,,0,0,11/07

I love this kind of opulence in a hotel and there are fewer and fewer of them as modern simplicity takes over. I felt that the service was second to none, from the friendly doorman to the front desk and room service, all were superb! It's crazy trying to pick a place to stay in NY so staying here felt like a little retreat from all the craziness and business just steps outside the hotel! The room was beautiful and again felt like a step back to a time of grandeur. I wish I had more time to enjoy it but with a million things to see and do in NY.....The location is great and I walked about 10 minutes to St Patricks Cathedral. All the shopping along 5th Ave was just around the corner! I think the main thing to figure out in NY is what you are planning to see and do and pick your hotel based on that. I did take the subway, but I'm not crazy about it as I come from a small town. Taxi's aren't my thing either and they seemed to be hard to flag down, so I always rely on what I can see and do on foot around the hotel. Travel is always such a personal thing.",Solo,79,5,Canada,,0,0,07/09

The chef made me an Excellent Vegan Breakfast and it was sent to the room and I can tell you it was extra special and i felt as if though i was a King! I was only there this time for one day, but I was treated very special and the hotel is top notch. There was one small hiccup which is OK, but there was a HUGE hairball in the guest bathroom shower. I only found it when I was taking pictures of everything. I called the butler and it was immediately removed, he grabbed it with bare hands against my wishes (I wanted him to at least use napkin or something) and whisked it out of the room with apologized and the manager soon called to apologize as well, which was more than enough I am sure this was a rare incident in a hotel like this and it was dealt with immediately and appropriately!
