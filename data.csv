Frequenttraveler082,Steps on Broadway - Day Classes,03/01,03/31/16,"I took an adult ballet class here, on a drop in basis. Easy registration process, extremely reasonable pricing, considering the studios are excellent spaces, great floors, live piano accompanists, and, dance teachers who have serious credentials. The instructor for the ballet class I took was Heather Hawk - fantastic teacher. She gave individual corrections, demonstrated for us, was encouraging and positive, and, gave clear instructions. There were only 7 of us in the class. I am convinced that the studio I was in is the same studio in a scene from When Harry Met Sally, where Sally is taking tap class. It was an absolute treat to be able to take this class.

First of all, the David Koch theater, located in Lincoln Center, is stunning which is a treat in and of itself. But on top of that, I found the ballet to be so beautiful, the dancing to fluid and graceful, that I was completely mesmerized for the full 2hrs, which went by so quickly it was almost like a dream. The performance I watched was La Sylphide, and it was everything you need in a story- romance, unrequited love, witches and fairies. It was followed by a set of what seemed to be more classic dance routines which were just as beautiful. All in all, it did not disappoint and I can assure that I will be going back for more before the season is over!

Luv2travel2014d,The Copacabana Times Square,01/01,None found,Went for New Years paid 260 for my fiancé and I. I was so excited to ring in the new year in what people say is the hottest club in NYC. After waiting OUTSIDE for almost 2 hours to get in because they say get there by 7 We got there at 6:15pm and went to one line then they made us got to another one. We waited in that one and did not get in until quarter after 8. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Open bar 4 hours- well less then that since we got in AFTER 8. That was a joke anyway it was cheap liquor and they didn't even carry or make half decent drinks. Bartender continued ignoring us at the bar. It was said floors 2 and 3 for general admission. We were stuck on ONE floor. Not at all what I paid for. Also said we would get New Years stuff I got a headband and the husband didn't get anything because they ran out of hats. When my husband asked if he could go outside and smoke they said ask security and security said not right now. The buffet was the only thing that surprised me to be half decent. The food was good but it was cold because they opened the stuff around 8:20 but nobody could eat until 9. As I have read through the reviews I notice you thank people for their positive reviews but not so much the negative. So I don't expect anything back because I'm sure you won't respond. Word of mouth is strong. I will continue to tell people U DON'T GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WHEN YOU BUY TICKETS TO THE NEW YEARS EVENT. Pictures from what lead me to purchase the event tickets here.

I came to this club from the Philly are for a private event of ballroom dance. Tickets were purchased 2 months prior. It was an extremely hot and humid day. Arrived after 6 pm and told they would not open til 7pm. We went across the street to a sports bar restaurant to have a snack and water to stay cool. At 7pm we ventured back and a line had formed outside and were still not letting anyone in. I stood in front of a pizza shop which had its oven exhaust blowing on me on top of the extreme heat outside. I started to not feel well due to the heat. Finally at 7:25 they started letting the line in. By the time I managed the second set of stairs I collapsed from the heat. If it were not for my husband to go in search of water to help revive me I do not know what would have happened. The security thugs in the place were pushing me down the steps and wanted me to go outside back into the heat which caused the problem, as opposed to letting me sit in a chair at the top of the landing and recover. A scene ensued to remove me to the outside to walk around and come back. We went back to sports bar and an angel of a hostess saw that I looked piqued and offered to give me a huge cup of ice water which made me feel so much better. I really wanted to go ballroom dancing and we came a long way. We returned and found that we could not attend the event by the security thugs. We were told to leave.

The manager leads me and my friend into the stairwell, now with two security guards, and claims theres no way to tell what happened and honestly finishes with ""what are you going to do about it?""?!?!?!?! I've never been in a bullying situation but I honestly never want to be again. We left immediately, all of us, it was so crazy. BUT they weren't done! When I looked at my account this morning they had added more money onto one of my already paid bills!

Highlights for us were the motion sensor cameras in which you are able to see your actions transferred onto a cartoon character. The television studio setup was also pretty cool to see. Unfortunately it seemed like several of the exhibits were not functioning to their fullest capacity, and for a lot of the children ran around spending 30 seconds to a minute at each station before finally plugging themselves in front of the Playstations on the bottom floor.

It takes under two hours and is a very nice break for kids between sightseeing activities. Some of the activities were too difficult for my youngest, but he had fun with what he could do. For parents with special needs children, your child may not be able to do everything, but they can have fun. If one area has too much stimulation, you can move along quickly, if one area is great for them, you can stay as long as you like. If you get tickets ahead of time, you avoid what can be a long wait.

Montravelguy,Sony Wonder Technology Lab,12/01,None found,"We went with the family to see the Sony Wonder Technology Lab during a family vacation shortly after Christmas. We called and reserved ahead, so there was no line to worry about or anything. Sony seems to have put a lot of effort into this place, but sadly it feels like since technology is changing so fast it is difficult for them to keep the wow factor. Highlights for us were the motion sensor cameras in which you are able to see your actions transferred onto a cartoon character. The television studio setup was also pretty cool to see. Unfortunately it seemed like several of the exhibits were not functioning to their fullest capacity, and for a lot of the children ran around spending 30 seconds to a minute at each station before finally plugging themselves in front of the Playstations on the bottom floor.

Jo E,The Ride NYC,03/01,04/06/16,"We had a New York pass and queued for an hour and a half to get tickets (from 8am) we were about 20th in the queue and got the show we wanted to see. Only one person needs to buy the tickets providing they have the New York passes. I'd recommend doing what we did - two of you go and take it in turns to queue whilst the other explores. Carlo's bakery is very close and nice and quiet at that time, so coffee and cannoli definitely helped with the waiting, and the waiting is definitely worth it..

The museum is a real treasure as its small size and helpful staff ensures a rewarding visit. Other: The museum is readily accessible by public transportation (e.g., the W157th Street station on the #1 subway line). If you plan on driving, you may wish to contact the museum for recommendations concerning locations of public parking garages.

ibadger,Hispanic Society of America,01/01,None found,"This place is relatively small in comparison to other museums. However, it still packs a punch with the high quality of ""big time"" museum pieces they seem to have on hand. The rooms are big and the art is great. Imagine, if you will, going into the Met or MOMA but instead of it being gigantic with 50 rooms, it is instead only about 7 or 8 rooms. But the rooms are still high ceiling, large, packed with great stuff. The building is a tad bit run down but that isn't really an issue. The huge, HUGE problem with this museum is the lighting is terrible. This is by far the worst lighting I've ever seen in a museum. I am not a lighting expert, so I know nothing about how that works. So if you do something so bad that a layman can see that you've done something wrong, then something is really wrong. The lights are somehow done that sometimes you literally can't see paintings even if you are straight on looking at them. Add to that problem that there is limited room to maneuver (for example, upstairs on the balcony level). It's one of those things where you look at something and the glare is so bad so you move over to a side to see it, that's the problem plaguing about 50% of the art here.

Here are surprisingly good works of art from bygone centuries from Spain, as well as from various Spanish-speaking countries in the Western Hemisphere, including paintings (el Greco, one Goya), religious statuary, porcelain, furniture, silver, marble, and more. ln the same compound, the Audubon Terrace Historic District, are several other interesting historic buildings: the Boricua College (originally American Geographical Society; 1911), with a majestic equestrian statue of el Cid; the former Museum of the American lndian (1922); the former American Numismatic Society (now American Academy of Arts and Letters Annex; 1907); the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1923); and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Esperanza (1912).

LynnO561,Hispanic Society of America,01/01,None found,"Like some of the other reviewers, I had never heard or visited this small gem of a museum. It is comprised of two floors with an open central area. The exhibits include ceramic plates from Spain, wooden inlaid chests from “Portuguese India”, elaborate iron door knockers from the 1500's, religious reliquaries and ancient marble stonework, paintings (including a few from El Greco, Sorolla and Goya), etc. The exterior of this early 1900's building is also to be admired as it was designed to be part of a collection of small museums. The museum is a real treasure as its small size and helpful staff ensures a rewarding visit. Other: The museum is readily accessible by public transportation (e.g., the W157th Street station on the #1 subway line). If you plan on driving, you may wish to contact the museum for recommendations concerning locations of public parking garages.

ibadger,Hispanic Society of America,01/01,None found,"This place is relatively small in comparison to other museums. However, it still packs a punch with the high quality of ""big time"" museum pieces they seem to have on hand. The rooms are big and the art is great. Imagine, if you will, going into the Met or MOMA but instead of it being gigantic with 50 rooms, it is instead only about 7 or 8 rooms. But the rooms are still high ceiling, large, packed with great stuff. The building is a tad bit run down but that isn't really an issue. The huge, HUGE problem with this museum is the lighting is terrible. This is by far the worst lighting I've ever seen in a museum. I am not a lighting expert, so I know nothing about how that works. So if you do something so bad that a layman can see that you've done something wrong, then something is really wrong. The lights are somehow done that sometimes you literally can't see paintings even if you are straight on looking at them. Add to that problem that there is limited room to maneuver (for example, upstairs on the balcony level). It's one of those things where you look at something and the glare is so bad so you move over to a side to see it, that's the problem plaguing about 50% of the art here.

TigerTravelTime,Broadway,03/01,04/09/16,"You are in NYC and this is some of the best theatre in the country I have seen. The cast and crews are so talented and there is real charm in these old buildings. Do your homework to determine what shows you are interested before you arrive and if they are going to be available for your visit and get an idea on what the retail prices are. The TKTS booth in Times Square has a limited number of tix for some (not all - and never Disney or wicked) which are anywhere between 30-50% off retail.i was surprised to be around people who were surprised that a 50% off price was more than their family wanted to spend. Please keep in mind that you need to get in line before the window opens if you are trying to nab a popular ticket (if the booth opens at 3, get there at 2:30). This trip we saw Fiddler on the Roof and Tuck Everlasting. Both were amazing! I would also remind you that if you see multiple shows in the same week, there is a VIP line line you can use after the first one which saves some time and you get first dibs on what is available.",56,Couples,,,No Age Found,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com//ShowUserReviews-g60763-d143361-r362762382-Broadway-New_York_City_New_York.html#REVIEWS,5733,Dance,No,0,13,05,Yes,Broadway is always a 5,,"New York City , NY", Aug 2012,5

Oh and here’s a tip, you should read the book before you see the musical. (This is totally optional.) If the story is not enough to interest you, go for the music, it is outstanding! I like the message for the song “Naughty” that Matilda sings. The message is even if you're little don’t let mean selfish bossy people stop you from doing what best for yourself. Oh, and lets not forget the acting, it is superb! The actor who impressed me the most was the actor who played Matilda. She was very convincing, and her singing voice was amazing!

Laura M,Matilda The Musical,03/01,03/27/16,"I am someone who has seen a LOT of theatre, most largely in London's West End and in US Tours. This actually was my first Broadway show in New York, and I have to say there is no better show. This was the sixth time I had seen the show, and I was a bit worried I would not enjoy it so much having seen it so many times. I went because my family wanted to see it and had not seen the Broadway version, just London and the US Tour. The original London version always will be the best in my opinion BUT this certainly was just as good. The London version has an advantage of having actors with a native British accent as well as an audience more in tune with the quirkiness of the show. This quirkiness is very British and very Roald Dahl. That is not to say Americans cannot enjoy it. Quite the opposite. It is the perfect dose of darkness tempered with heart. The performers are incredible talented, especially the young actresses playing Maitlda. We saw Alexandra Vlachos, and she gave one of the best performances of the title role I have seen. The actors playing Matilda's parents and Miss Trunchbull also were excellent. There are many complaints about not being able to understand the lyrics from American audiences who can not catch the fast-paced and British-accented dialogue.

TheFlyingZombie,Late Night With Seth Meyers,04/01,04/08/16,"Maybe one of the cooler things we did in NYC. There's quite a bit of waiting but it's worth it. I've seen people complaining about showing up early and being seated in the back. I think it has to do with what you are wearing and slightly about how you look. If you are dressed nice and cleaned up, they'll seat you near the front. We were the very last people to show up (got on the wrong train oops) and we were still seated near the front.

Hokie69,Late Night With Seth Meyers,03/01,03/19/16,"When visiting NYC recently we wanted to take in one of the late night TV shows at Rockefeller Center and were able to get tickets to Late Night with Seth Myers. The ticketing process is a bit of a logistical nightmare because you have to apply a month in advance through a convoluted process at 1iota.com. The tickets are free but you don't know if you have them until a few days before the date you requested. After having tickets in hand the process is much more user-friendly. NBC does a nice job of telling you exactly what you have to do, where to go, and when to be there. Note though that you must do exactly as the instructions stipulate or you will not be admitted. Tickets cannot be transferred and security is very tight. You line up at 445 pm at the designated spot at 30 Rock and go through security and are given your tickets. No photos are allowed once you pass this spot - NONE! You are then directed to a comfortable waiting area where you will sit for approximately an hour. If you want a photo of your group an intern will take one and email it to you which you can later post on social media. When show time rolls around you are taken to Studio 8G and while waling in you can get a glimpse of Studio 8H where Saturday Night Live is staged. An intern will direct you to one of 200 seats and a warm up comedian will welcome you and let you know how the show will proceed. The 8G band is introduced then Seth Myers comes out and the show begins. It is a fast paced very funny show with famous guests from around the world and Seth Myers is one of the most intelligent and funny guys on TV. He would be a great person with whom to spend an evening. He comes across as a very personable guy who really, really, really enjoys his work. At one point in the show he will come up into the audience to take questions. Once the show is over you are escorted from the studio and will exit through the NBC store in case you want to buy a souvenir.

Dave S,Union Square,08/01,04/08/16,"This very welcome urban green space at the bottom end of Midtown is formed by the intersection of Broadway with what was originally called 4th Avenue, today north of here called Park Avenue. The area around it was once the headquarters of some of the most obnoxious far-left organizations in the country. ln addition, it has long been the domicile of a magnificent statue of war criminal mass murderer Abraham Lincoln, the destroyer of the South, white-suprmacist and anti-Semite; today, the equally unpleasant statue of Mohandas ""Mahatma"" Gandhi - also a notorious anti-Semite - joins it. But don't let this hamper your enjoyment of the beautiful park, in whose northern sections you can sit unbothered by the sight of these effigies.

The playground is pretty special too. It’s located at the north end of the park and has very innovative equipment that is fairly new. The playground has a separate section for toddlers which has a swing set, climbing platform, sand and water play area. Our daughter’s favorite part is the area for older kids. In this section they have a unique dome which is very challenging to climb. My daughter never gives up and always manages to get to the top. Once you’re up there you get a great view and sense of pride for your accomplishment. It’s also really fun to slide back down.

The area around it was once the headquarters of some of the most obnoxious far-left organizations in the country. ln addition, it has long been the domicile of a magnificent statue of war criminal mass murderer Abraham Lincoln, the destroyer of the South, white-suprmacist and anti-Semite; today, the equally unpleasant statue of Mohandas ""Mahatma"" Gandhi - also a notorious anti-Semite - joins it.

During the walk Dennis B. provided detailed information about the history of area, buildings and culture. He presented past NYC news related to the Hell's Kitchen district and there was also time for small talk. During the tour we visited three bars, which were not very special, but seemed authentic, which was of course the most important thing. I would definitely do similar pub crawl again in Hell's Kitchen or some other district. I would recommend this tour especially to get factual insight about NYC, meet new people and enjoy a few drinks.

Then we booked a three hour tour of 9 11 our guide Annie did turn up and it started great "" the first 10 minutes"" after that she was disinterested in any questions put to her and kept dismissing what we had to say, our tour consisted of us stopping so she could have a ciggerette break and our main topic was how much she normally gets tipped, our 3 hour tour lasted about 40 minutes. So we took ourselves off to the 9 11 museum, which was fantastic.

The tour guide Dennis B. was great! He is a real new yorker with ""NYC attitude"", which was perfect. In total our group was four people. During the walk Dennis B. provided detailed information about the history of area, buildings and culture. He presented past NYC news related to the Hell's Kitchen district and there was also time for small talk. During the tour we visited three bars, which were not very special, but seemed authentic, which was of course the most important thing. I would definitely do similar pub crawl again in Hell's Kitchen or some other district. I would recommend this tour especially to get factual insight about NYC, meet new people and enjoy a few drinks.

We’re also huge fans of the 20-foot-tall Slide Mountain jungle gym. Their 6,000-square-foot sandbox is also impressive.

This playground was designed by architects who teamed with childhood development experts and together they produced quite a masterpiece. The grounds include four different areas: Swing Valley, Slide Mountain, Sandbox Village and Water Lab. Each section is secluded in it’s own enclave surrounded by landscaping making it feel like there’s a new discovery at every turn. Kids are in for a real adventure as they explore each area. Our favorite activity is the rope swings in Swing Valley (which were not working our last visit but hopefully will be repaired soon). We’re also huge fans of the 20-foot-tall Slide Mountain jungle gym. Their 6,000-square-foot sandbox is also impressive. During the summer they also have a pop up pool, cafe, volleyball and other fun summer activities. We’ve never played in their Water lab but it looks fantastic.

Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation are the authorities for this park with their mission to provide “world class recreational, environmental and cultural destination” to its residents, and they have succeeded in providing a wonderful place to New Yorkers. Since i am more familiar with Pier area and since each Pier area developed has its own uniqueness, beauty and charm, I need to be fare enough to write a few lines,separately on each Pier area and off course, i have written a few lines on other areas too. Pier -1: This area has three large landscaped lawns, playground for children, granite view stand/steps and also has developed and maintained gardens with native plant life and freshwater plants. One can sit in the lawns or on the granite view stand/steps for hours with friends & families or simply sit in front of the water front,viewing the Lower Manhattan skyline and watch a variety of moving boats. Pier-1 lawns are the place where various events are organised throughout the year; dance parties, movies on the open screen, workouts and even various science festivals are held.

Pier - 3: This area is known for its Greenway granite terrace with granite blocks and the unusually designed,sloping hills running all along the Pier-3 ( As per the records the hills are designed in such a way that it dilutes the intensity of sound (from nearby Brooklyn/ Queens expressway),resulting in reduction in noise pollution. Pier-3 also has two beautifully landscaped lawns and even have library. One can get awesome view of New York Harbour, besides the Governors Island and Statue of Liberty. Pier - 4: This is one place along the piers forming the part of Brooklyn Bridge Park development, where one can get a feel of the beach with sand and can literally reach the edge of the water.

There is a bird island, part of the nature preserve,but the entry to this area is restricted. Pier - 5: Consist of a well developed fields for football (soccer) and rugby with facility with spectator viewing stands/benches lined up on the sides.

We were warned in advance that is may be standing room only but myself and my partner got seats at the back. My partner has good hearing and mine is a bit shoddy in my left but we really struggled to hear some of the troupes. Those that were better at projecting their voices got more laughs from the audience in general as well as ourselves - those that couldn't project or when they were turned away from the front often meant that jokes got lost by the time they reached us at the back. The compere with the guitar had no problem making himself heard, and in general we found the evening enjoyable - just wish we could have heard everything. $5 was a decent price for the experience though, its just frustrating when I feel that the UCB brand is quite a bigged up one.

Oh yeah, the Alice Austen house: a warm welcome awaits, this is a superb old house with lovely photos, it's a very calm world away from the (admittedly wonderful too) insanity across the water, and they suggest that each visitor pay a mere $3!

It was about an hour's ride but for $3 each you can't complain! It was a cold day and I believe Coney Island had just opened for the season so it wasn't too busy but I can imagine on a warm summer's day, it would be a very different experience. The kids (and several adults) easily blew through $220 riding a few of the coasters so I can also imagine that you could spend a small fortune if you were here for an extended period of time! Still our kids had a great time and enjoyed riding the Cyclone. We also managed to take a stroll along the boardwalk which was fabulous.

We caught the subway out to Coney Island and was amazed at how beautiful the beach was. We are from Australia and pride ourselves on our beautiful Beaches so we thought Coney Island beach was okay. We didn't realise that nothing really opened u til later in the day so we Simply walked up and down the pier admiring the place. We found a great bar (Ruby's Bar) to buy hot chocolates from and purchased hotdogs from Nathan's. At 12 Luna park opened up and by this stage there were more people about. I'm glad we made the effort to come out to Coney Island because it shows that there is more to NY than just Times Square.,163,Couples,1,Australia, 35-49 year old female ,103,https://www.tripadvisor.com//ShowUserReviews-g60827-d106173-r361907011-Coney_Island_USA-Brooklyn_New_York.html#REVIEWS,20347,Dance,No,0,122,06,No,A nice escape from the city,,"Surf Ave , Brooklyn , NY 11224", Jan 2008,5

It was about an hour's ride but for $3 each you can't complain! It was a cold day and I believe Coney Island had just opened for the season so it wasn't too busy but I can imagine on a warm summer's day, it would be a very different experience. The kids (and several adults) easily blew through $220 riding a few of the coasters so I can also imagine that you could spend a small fortune if you were here for an extended period of time! Still our kids had a great time and enjoyed riding the Cyclone. We also managed to take a stroll along the boardwalk which was fabulous. The beach looked lovely but it was too cold to even contemplate taking a paddle.

The room with the fountain and waterlily pond is an unexpectedly joyful highlight of the garden. The day we went, which was midday on a Thursday, was perfect.

Lin533,New York Botanical Garden,03/01,04/03/16,"I visited here with two friends on a cloudy, warmish spring day. We had to park across the street which is not very convenient if you have a handicapped person with you, which we did. Even so, the walk to the entrance of the gardens and then on to the conservatory was short. The entrance fee is very fair considering all that these gardens have to offer. We went to see the annual Orchidelirium. Not only do you get to enjoy numerous varieties of orchids from around the world but you get to experience a rain forest and a desert among other biomes. The room with the fountain and waterlily pond is an unexpectedly joyful highlight of the garden. The day we went, which was midday on a Thursday, was perfect. There had been some school groups there but they seemed to be leaving by the time we arrived. I got to take many photos of flowers and plants which is one of my favorite things to do.

Many vibrant colors of flowers were in the various indoor gardens, and even though we've been to the site numerous times, we always feel we are seeing new things. The flowers grow differently each year after all! We also rode on the tram to see the magnolia trees in bloom.

A couple weeks before traveling to NYC to finish out mortuary school I had applied online for tickets. A few days before arriving in town I received a call from The Late Show promotions department offering two tickets. Needless to say I was ecstatic. The problem I ran into was that my classes for the day our tickets were for, Tuesday, were not to let out until 3pm. The LS staff needed us there before 3. The theater was just a few blocks from my school. Needless to say the school said there would be no early dismissal. Regrettably I had to pass on the tickets. Here's where it gets good; when Tuesday rolled around, I of course, went to my classes. At 2:15 the instructor said unexpectedly, ""Ok, that's it, see everyone tomorrow"" I sat stunned. I quickly ran out of the building, caught a cab down to the Port Authority to meet up with my wife, caught another cab; and made a mad dash to the Ed Sullivan Theater. We were told that we could be placed on a ""standby"" list for tickets if any would be left for the evening's show. Long and the short of it; we waited around the corner with a group of people, all hoping to get it ... We GOT IN!! #36 & 37 of 39. Our seats were in the last row in the upper left of the balcony right above the sound board for the orchestra. Could not see Paul Shaffer, but we knew he was there.

Long and the short of it; we waited around the corner with a group of people, all hoping to get it ... We GOT IN!! #36 & 37 of 39. Our seats were in the last row in the upper left of the balcony right above the sound board for the orchestra. Could not see Paul Shaffer, but we knew he was there. We had a ""reasonable"" view of the set and of course Dave. Billy Crystal and Connie Chen were Dave's guest. BOTTOM LINE: We got to see and experience Letterman in his final few weeks before his farewell.

- CLOSED",05/01,None found,"I requested tickets online about a month in advance and never herd back so assumed there were none available. While in New York, a staff member from the show called, asked us a trivia question and then gave us tickets. We arrived the day of to pick them up and had to wait in line for about 45 minutes. We then left and came back at 3:30 as requested and waiting for about an hour in another line. The waiting was boring and there were no bathrooms, but once inside the theater, it is 100% worth it. The band was amazing, Dave was amazing and did take time to talk to the audience. Martin Short, Norah Jones, and Cher were on the show and we had the best time. I am so thankful we were able to see Dave before he retires.
