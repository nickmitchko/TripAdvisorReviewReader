The Rockettes that taught my daughter's class were so lovely, friendly and kind to all of the girls. My daughter was so excited to learn parts from the actual dances the Rockettes are still performing today. The backstage tour was fun and I think her favourite part was learning to high kick. It gave her a new respect for how flawless they make it look on the stage! The show was so fun to see and they are so impressive with their technique and presentation. A great way to get ready for Christmas!

Firstly, the queuing process to obtain tickets was a total joke. Using the NYpass meant limited ticketing options but how arduous and inconvenient they make it is inexcusable. We got ours on our 3rd attempt after the previous 2 times were sold out. It involved waiting in line at 8am, an hour before the box office opened to get a \"pre-ticket\" followed by waiting at another line to get the actual ticket. The whole process took a good 2-3hours. Sorry but this is just frankly not acceptable. I have seen ticketing process done in 3rd world countries done far more efficiently than how the Ride team does it.

The surrounding streets aren't too busy with traffic, so it's not particularly noisy. There are some 'kiosk' style cafes and plenty of seats, and trees and flowerbeds line the edges.

Additionally, my impression of Manhattan was quite different that what I expected, considering I hadn't been there in years. The people seemed rather laid back and for the most part, very friendly and overall, I never saw any type of problem. It appears that people there basically wanted to have a good time even though it is quite active with the hustle and bustle and tourist. Yet, I enjoyed New York greatly and look forward to retun and to have a good time, eating, spending money and seeing the sights. Also, about the Garment District, we encountered a number of merchants who said they were going out of business as a result of being squeezed out in terms of extremely high rental space, which is out of the question for a number of merchants.

Great prices and neverending selections that you will not find in mainstream fabric stores. For the shopping part, you have to read the doors which will indicate if it a wholesale or sample store. Sample store, you are in and bring cash! Here is the skinny, if like me, you have teenages who are planning to go to the typical dances. Instead of buying dresses from a catalog or spending $$$$ on a dress, GO TO THE GARMENT district. We did not get a dress because we did not have room but I saw a gown that was in Macys for over $200 for $15.

Additionally, my impression of Manhattan was quite different that what I expected, considering I hadn't been there in years. The people seemed rather laid back and for the most part, very friendly and overall, I never saw any type of problem. It appears that people there basically wanted to have a good time even though it is quite active with the hustle and bustle and tourist. Yet, I enjoyed New York greatly and look forward to retun and to have a good time, eating, spending money and seeing the sights. Also, about the Garment District, we encountered a number of merchants who said they were going out of business as a result of being squeezed out in terms of extremely high rental space, which is out of the question for a number of merchants. Considering there is much history with the Garment District that is known worldwide, I hope there is a way to preserve the importance of the Garment District and support the germent merchants realizing they provide an important service for fashion designers and others who travel there seeking top quality fabrics and other merchandise and to even support their own businesses.", "ReviewerNumReviews": "8", "ReviewType": "Couples", "ReviewHelpful": "1", "ReviewerLocationState": "Delaware", "ReviewerAge": "No Age Found", "ReviewerPhotos": "", "ReviewURL": "https://www.tripadvisor.com//ShowUserReviews-g60763-d615520-r315168461-Garment_District-New_York_City_New_York.html#REVIEWS", "ReviewerPoints": "824", "ClassType": "Dance", "ReviewPicture": "No", "ReviewNumPic": 0, "ReviewerNumHelpful": "4", "ReviewerLevelContrib": "02", "ReviewMobile": "No", "ReviewTitle": "The Garment District", "ReviewerLocationCity": "Wilmington", "ProviderLocation": "Manhattan , New York City , NY", "ReviewerSince": " Aug 2015", "PointsRate": "4"}, {"ReviewerName": "Jan M", "ProviderName": "Garment District", "DateVisited": "07/01", "ReviewDate": "None found", "ReviewText": "Mood fabrics was absolutely my Mecca.

But the rooms are still high ceiling, large, packed with great stuff. The building is a tad bit run down but that isn't really an issue. The huge, HUGE problem with this museum is the lighting is terrible. This is by far the worst lighting I've ever seen in a museum. I am not a lighting expert, so I know nothing about how that works. So if you do something so bad that a layman can see that you've done something wrong, then something is really wrong. The lights are somehow done that sometimes you literally can't see paintings even if you are straight on looking at them. Add to that problem that there is limited room to maneuver (for example, upstairs on the balcony level). It's one of those things where you look at something and the glare is so bad so you move over to a side to see it, that's the problem plaguing about 50% of the art here.

The museum is a real treasure as its small size and helpful staff ensures a rewarding visit.

If you plan on driving, you may wish to contact the museum for recommendations concerning locations of public parking garages.

But the rooms are still high ceiling, large, packed with great stuff. The building is a tad bit run down but that isn't really an issue. The huge, HUGE problem with this museum is the lighting is terrible. This is by far the worst lighting I've ever seen in a museum. I am not a lighting expert, so I know nothing about how that works. So if you do something so bad that a layman can see that you've done something wrong, then something is really wrong. The lights are somehow done that sometimes you literally can't see paintings even if you are straight on looking at them. Add to that problem that there is limited room to maneuver (for example, upstairs on the balcony level). It's one of those things where you look at something and the glare is so bad so you move over to a side to see it, that's the problem plaguing about 50% of the art here. Otherwise, for free it is a great way to spend 30 to 60 minutes.

Well Matilda the musical is the absolute best musical on broadway! It\u2019s the perfect show for you and your family! I can prove it! First, I have to tell you the story is very interesting! The story is based on a book by Roald Dahl (called Matilda) and It\u2019s about a girl who is super smart. Okay. I don\u2019t want to spoil the story. So let\u2019s move on. Oh and here\u2019s a tip, you should read the book before you see the musical. (This is totally optional.) If the story is not enough to interest you, go for the music, it is outstanding! I like the message for the song \u201cNaughty\u201d that Matilda sings. The message is even if you're little don\u2019t let mean selfish bossy people stop you from doing what best for yourself. Oh, and lets not forget the acting, it is superb! The actor who impressed me the most was the actor who played Matilda. She was very convincing, and her singing voice was amazing! She is an American 9 year old who plays a English 5 year old! (her brittish accent is really good.) This musical is awesome! I can\u2019t recommend it enough!

The second is for older kids, it\u2019s a classic playground with swings, jungle gym, sand pit and slides. The third area is what\u2019s really special, it\u2019s called Mounds Play Area. This area consists of contoured artificial turf mounds with a pretty amazing spider-web-like ropes course above it. This area also has traditional monkey bars and other interesting climbing structures. Our daughter loves to kick off her shoes and run free in this section.

The ticketing process is a bit of a logistical nightmare because you have to apply a month in advance through a convoluted process at 1iota.com. The tickets are free but you don't know if you have them until a few days before the date you requested. After having tickets in hand the process is much more user-friendly. NBC does a nice job of telling you exactly what you have to do, where to go, and when to be there. Note though that you must do exactly as the instructions stipulate or you will not be admitted. Tickets cannot be transferred and security is very tight. You line up at 445 pm at the designated spot at 30 Rock and go through security and are given your tickets. No photos are allowed once you pass this spot - NONE! You are then directed to a comfortable waiting area where you will sit for approximately an hour. If you want a photo of your group an intern will take one and email it to you which you can later post on social media. When show time rolls around you are taken to Studio 8G and while waling in you can get a glimpse of Studio 8H where Saturday Night Live is staged. An intern will direct you to one of 200 seats and a warm up comedian will welcome you and let you know how the show will proceed. The 8G band is introduced then Seth Myers comes out and the show begins. It is a fast paced very funny show with famous guests from around the world and Seth Myers is one of the most intelligent and funny guys on TV. He would be a great person with whom to spend an evening. He comes across as a very personable guy who really, really, really enjoys his work. At one point in the show he will come up into the audience to take questions. Once the show is over you are escorted from the studio and will exit through the NBC store in case you want to buy a souvenir. The whole process from standing in line to the end of the show was about 3 hours.

We reported to \"30 Rock\" got in line at about 4:45, and the step by step process of checking in and finally getting into the studio took about 90 minutes. Everything about it was super-efficient. The warm up comedian went over how we were supposed to act and react throughout the taping, but we didn't even need the direction. Seeing Meyers in person at this desk was like watching an extended version of Weekend Update from SNL. The highlight of the evening was a break while they set up for that night's musical group. During that time, Seth came up into the audience and answered every question people through at him for 10-15 minutes. Very down-to-earth and just naturally funny. Plus he stood right at the end of our row almost the whole time. The tickets were not particularly hard to get, and we had a great time.

Basically show up when they ask you to and the interns will allow everyone to line up, show their ID and ticket confirmations to receive their actual tickets. They give you a ticket with a letter or number on it and have you wait in a nice lounge with comfortable seating. When it is time they then call you up to enter the studio by ticket letter/number. They show you to your seat while a warm up comedian interacts with the audience. Seth comes out and the show begins. During the break while they were setting up for the musical guest Seth came into the audience and answered audience questions for about 10 minutes which was kind of neat.

As an audience member you're encouraged to be as interactive as possible without being disruptive.

The ticketing process is a bit of a logistical nightmare because you have to apply a month in advance through a convoluted process at 1iota.com. The tickets are free but you don't know if you have them until a few days before the date you requested. After having tickets in hand the process is much more user-friendly. NBC does a nice job of telling you exactly what you have to do, where to go, and when to be there. Note though that you must do exactly as the instructions stipulate or you will not be admitted. Tickets cannot be transferred and security is very tight. You line up at 445 pm at the designated spot at 30 Rock and go through security and are given your tickets. No photos are allowed once you pass this spot - NONE! You are then directed to a comfortable waiting area where you will sit for approximately an hour. If you want a photo of your group an intern will take one and email it to you which you can later post on social media. When show time rolls around you are taken to Studio 8G and while waling in you can get a glimpse of Studio 8H where Saturday Night Live is staged. An intern will direct you to one of 200 seats and a warm up comedian will welcome you and let you know how the show will proceed. The 8G band is introduced then Seth Myers comes out and the show begins. It is a fast paced very funny show with famous guests from around the world and Seth Myers is one of the most intelligent and funny guys on TV. He would be a great person with whom to spend an evening. He comes across as a very personable guy who really, really, really enjoys his work. At one point in the show he will come up into the audience to take questions. Once the show is over you are escorted from the studio and will exit through the NBC store in case you want to buy a souvenir. The whole process from standing in line to the end of the show was about 3 hours.

We chose Seth Meyers - and we were glad we did. First, for out-of-town guest like ourselves, we were assured we could get in - unlike Colbert. We reported to \"30 Rock\" got in line at about 4:45, and the step by step process of checking in and finally getting into the studio took about 90 minutes. Everything about it was super-efficient. The warm up comedian went over how we were supposed to act and react throughout the taping, but we didn't even need the direction. Seeing Meyers in person at this desk was like watching an extended version of Weekend Update from SNL. The highlight of the evening was a break while they set up for that night's musical group. During that time, Seth came up into the audience and answered every question people through at him for 10-15 minutes. Very down-to-earth and just naturally funny. Plus he stood right at the end of our row almost the whole time. The tickets were not particularly hard to get, and we had a great time.

We\u2019re also huge fans of the 20-foot-tall Slide Mountain jungle gym. Their 6,000-square-foot sandbox is also impressive.

Since i am more familiar with Pier area and since each Pier area developed has its own uniqueness, beauty and charm, I need to be fare enough to write a few lines,separately on each Pier area and off course, i have written a few lines on other areas too. Pier -1: This area has three large landscaped lawns, playground for children, granite view stand/steps and also has developed and maintained gardens with native plant life and freshwater plants.

Pier - 3: This area is known for its Greenway granite terrace with granite blocks and the unusually designed,sloping hills running all along the Pier-3 ( As per the records the hills are designed in such a way that it dilutes the intensity of sound (from nearby Brooklyn/ Queens expressway),resulting in reduction in noise pollution. Pier-3 also has two beautifully landscaped lawns and even have library. One can get awesome view of New York Harbour, besides the Governors Island and Statue of Liberty. Pier - 4: This is one place along the piers forming the part of Brooklyn Bridge Park development, where one can get a feel of the beach with sand and can literally reach the edge of the water.

Plus, the mystique of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler (founders) add juju and raises expectations. Setting is intimate, a thrust stage and seating capacity of 140 plus 20 standing room. friendly bar prices included wine or beer for $6. DOWNSIDE: Why, why, why were there no people of color and only one woman out of the 8 performers we saw? This doesn't look like a diverse array of talent, and it diminishes the Fey & Poehler association. There are up to 50 bad seats in the house, mostly those closest to the back wall in the 2 side sections. There are 10 or more bad seats in the center section due to a column that obstructs views. We attended the 7:30 and 9:00 PM perfs on Jan. 30 in which both improv teams stayed stage right for a large chunk of time making the closest side section a poor vantage point and probably half of the other side action, too. ADVICE TO MANAGEMENT: you are grossing $1 million-plus annually in ticket revenue alone so either renovate to introduce a proscenium stage or get out of 307 W. 26th. The current facility is a disservice to your business, school, performers and AUDIENCE. Also.....fellow theater and improv lovers, please know that though these improv artists are worth far more than $11 it isn't what you want if sketch comedy or stand-up are what you are looking for.

We were warned in advance that is may be standing room only but myself and my partner got seats at the back. My partner has good hearing and mine is a bit shoddy in my left but we really struggled to hear some of the troupes.

DOWNSIDE: Why, why, why were there no people of color and only one woman out of the 8 performers we saw? This doesn't look like a diverse array of talent, and it diminishes the Fey & Poehler association. There are up to 50 bad seats in the house, mostly those closest to the back wall in the 2 side sections. There are 10 or more bad seats in the center section due to a column that obstructs views. We attended the 7:30 and 9:00 PM perfs on Jan. 30 in which both improv teams stayed stage right for a large chunk of time making the closest side section a poor vantage point and probably half of the other side action, too. ADVICE TO MANAGEMENT: you are grossing $1 million-plus annually in ticket revenue alone so either renovate to introduce a proscenium stage or get out of 307 W. 26th. The current facility is a disservice to your business, school, performers and AUDIENCE. Also.....fellow theater and improv lovers, please know that though these improv artists are worth far more than $11 it isn't what you want if sketch comedy or stand-up are what you are looking for.

The tiny souvernir shop couldn't have been better.", "ReviewerNumReviews": "10", "ReviewType": "Couples", "ReviewHelpful": "1", "ReviewerLocationState": "Russia", "ReviewerAge": " 25-34 year old female ", "ReviewerPhotos": "", "ReviewURL": "https://www.tripadvisor.com//ShowUserReviews-g60763-d136072-r352499481-Governor_s_Island-New_York_City_New_York.html#REVIEWS", "ReviewerPoints": "1103", "ClassType": "Dance", "ReviewPicture": "No", "ReviewNumPic": 0, "ReviewerNumHelpful": "3", "ReviewerLevelContrib": "03", "ReviewMobile": "No", "ReviewTitle": "Perfect getaway from the crowds & noise", "ReviewerLocationCity": "Vladivostok", "ProviderLocation": "New York Harbor , Ferry Terminal , New York City , NY 10004", "ReviewerSince": " Nov 2008", "PointsRate": "5"}, {"ReviewerName": "Michael C", "ProviderName": "Governor's Island", "DateVisited": "08/01", "ReviewDate": "None found", "ReviewText": "Took an afternoon trip over to Governor's Island as an outing for our Lower Manhattan office staff.

Single ride is $2.75 so $30 is quite easy to break even. Because subway has many lines, when you are in the subway, make certain you are at the right platform. The first time we were in the subway, waiting for line 6, we saw so many Q, and S trains came by but no 6. Waited 20 minutes, and finally realized, we had to follow the plat form and go to a lower level.... walk about another 5 minutes to get to the line 6 platform. Back to DUMBO. DUMBO is a little area under Brooklyn bridge. It has many hip stores, and quite quaint. There is also a small play ground and park near by the river. The Ferris Wheel was closed. Kids had a great time just throwing rocks on the river side. Crossing the bridge is fun too. Then we found Juliana's Pizza close by. It was worth the walk.

The prices were reasonable, ranging from $3-5 per activity. There are also food stalls so you can get a snack. A lot of places are *cash only* so make sure you have money with you. There were so many pumpkins! Even as an adult I was excited, so kids will love it, as well as all the animals. I would give the hayride a miss, we lined up for quite a while for essentially two loops of the car park. It is a bumpy ride and you don't really see anything. We didn't do the maze, but it looked loads of fun. We toured the farm house, which was around 45 mins, I would say only do this if you have time after everything else, as there are only 3 rooms to see and the commentary can be a bit slow, but 'Mister Marty' is really nice and knowledgeable about the farm. There is also a little farm shop that is worth a look, where you can buy eggs. It is a fun day out for adults and families.

The prices were reasonable, ranging from $3-5 per activity. There are also food stalls so you can get a snack. A lot of places are *cash only* so make sure you have money with you. There were so many pumpkins! Even as an adult I was excited, so kids will love it, as well as all the animals. I would give the hayride a miss, we lined up for quite a while for essentially two loops of the car park. It is a bumpy ride and you don't really see anything. We didn't do the maze, but it looked loads of fun. We toured the farm house, which was around 45 mins, I would say only do this if you have time after everything else, as there are only 3 rooms to see and the commentary can be a bit slow, but 'Mister Marty' is really nice and knowledgeable about the farm. There is also a little farm shop that is worth a look, where you can buy eggs. It is a fun day out for adults and families.

Well, on Mon., May 11, 2015 the call came for tickets for the NEXT NIGHT'S show. I'm in Kansas City and would have to drop everything and fly out there on short notice, but this is a bucket list thing, so I accepted the offer! However, in order to claim the tickets, you had to answer an easy Late Show trivia question. In this case, it was \"What instrument does Paul Shaffer play on the show?\" The nice thing is that they took down the names of myself and my friend, who I conned into also dropping everything and going, so the tickets were now guaranteed, as long as we showed up between 3:00-4:00 PM the day of the taping and we had photo ID. There wasn't any threat of flying all the way out there and not having tickets. So, now I've got tickets, but being in Kansas City, I had to figure out how to get there. Having never been to New York, we sprang for the earliest flight there and the latest flight home to maximize our time in NYC. So, we flew into LaGuardia and took the E train to the Ed Sullivan Theater, got in line at 3:00 PM, where we were led into the theater to get our tickets. Showed the photo ID and we got our tickets. They normally tape at 4:30, but this day Bill Clinton was one of the guests and they moved the taping back an hour to accommodate schedules. So, we were told to leave the theater and come back at 4:50 to get into another line to actually get in for the show. So, Times Square is actually about 10 blocks away, so it was a no-brainer to hang out there, grab a bite and a drink and just people watch while we waited. We went back and got some Late Show gear at the Hello Deli, around the corner from the theater, and got a photo taken with the owner, Rupert Jee. We got in the 4:50 PM line and were actually led into the theater. I read on previous Trip Advisor reviews that they make you check bags and cell phones, but they didn't do either to us. They just ask that phones are turned completely off (so, no photos allowed inside the theater), and they do have numerous pages running around before, during and after the taping in the audience looking to tell people to put their phones away, so unfortunately, I couldn't get away with taking photos inside the theater. There doesn't seem to be a method on how they seat you--some people in our line went down to the floor, some went up into the balcony. We happened to sit in the balcony, which bummed us out at first, but we heard the view is much better up there because all the cameras aren't in the way like they would be downstairs. The taping itself was great...before the show started, announcer Alan Kalter warmed up the crowd, the CBS Orchestra played a couple of numbers, Paul Shaffer was brought out to a huge ovation and then Dave himself came out to take questions from the audience for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 5:45 PM, the show started, and it's just like what you see on TV, except now you get to see what happens during the commercial breaks. Most breaks Dave got up and went backstage only to return a few seconds before coming back on the air to host the next segment. The band plays throughout the entire commercial and they really did sound great. The guests were Bill Clinton and Adam Sandler for Dave's 7th to last show. The Ed Sullivan Theater really looks much larger on TV...even though we sat in the balcony, you felt like you were only 100 feet away from Dave and the stage. The taping was over at about 6:45 PM. With the show taping an hour later than we originally were planning for, we had to hustle and get a cab (instead of a train) to get to Newark to fly out at 8:30 PM. We made it home to Kansas City by 10:30 PM, so it was a 17-hour crazy adventure that cost an arm and a leg, but to be able to now say that I got to see Dave in person on his second-to-last week, that's pretty priceless!", "ReviewerNumReviews": "5", "ReviewType": "Solo", "ReviewHelpful": "7", "ReviewerLocationState": "MO", "ReviewerAge": " 35-49 year old male ", "ReviewerPhotos": "", "ReviewURL": "https://www.tripadvisor.com//ShowUserReviews-g60763-d555916-r271950761-The_Late_Show_with_David_Letterman-New_York_City_New_York.html#REVIEWS", "ReviewerPoints": "517", "ClassType": "Dance", "ReviewPicture": "No", "ReviewNumPic": 0, "ReviewerNumHelpful": "17", "ReviewerLevelContrib": "02", "ReviewMobile": "No", "ReviewTitle": "A whirlwind adventure", "ReviewerLocationCity": "Kansas City", "ProviderLocation": "Ed Sullivan Theater, 1697 Broadway, between 53rd and 54th Sts , New York City , NY", "ReviewerSince": " Jul 2010", "PointsRate": "5"}, {"ReviewerName": "Iskender83", "ProviderName": "The Late Show with David Letterman\n- CLOSED", "DateVisited": "12/01", "ReviewDate": "None found", "ReviewText": "I love that show and when I was in front of Ed Sullivan theatre it was great.

A couple weeks before traveling to NYC to finish out mortuary school I had applied online for tickets. A few days before arriving in town I received a call from The Late Show promotions department offering two tickets. Needless to say I was ecstatic. The problem I ran into was that my classes for the day our tickets were for, Tuesday, were not to let out until 3pm. The LS staff needed us there before 3. The theater was just a few blocks from my school. Needless to say the school said there would be no early dismissal. Regrettably I had to pass on the tickets. Here's where it gets good; when Tuesday rolled around, I of course, went to my classes. At 2:15 the instructor said unexpectedly, \"Ok, that's it, see everyone tomorrow\" I sat stunned. I quickly ran out of the building, caught a cab down to the Port Authority to meet up with my wife, caught another cab; and made a mad dash to the Ed Sullivan Theater. We were told that we could be placed on a \"standby\" list for tickets if any would be left for the evening's show. Long and the short of it; we waited around the corner with a group of people, all hoping to get it ... We GOT IN!! #36 & 37 of 39. Our seats were in the last row in the upper left of the balcony right above the sound board for the orchestra. Could not see Paul Shaffer, but we knew he was there. We had a \"reasonable\" view of the set and of course Dave. Billy Crystal and Connie Chen were Dave's guest.

When your group is called they take you to the theatre, go over a few rules, and the band does some warm up songs. Once the show starts its very interesting how it is all laid out. Obviously you can't see the on screen graphics, but its really cool to see what Dave does when he is not on camera. The biggest surprise is they allow the band to restart if they mess up and editing will cut a seamless show afterwards. Dave does a lot of interacting with the audience and it even continued during the show, which lead to some hilarious inside jokes that I am sure didn't translate as well on tv.

Well, on Mon., May 11, 2015 the call came for tickets for the NEXT NIGHT'S show. I'm in Kansas City and would have to drop everything and fly out there on short notice, but this is a bucket list thing, so I accepted the offer! However, in order to claim the tickets, you had to answer an easy Late Show trivia question. In this case, it was \"What instrument does Paul Shaffer play on the show?\" The nice thing is that they took down the names of myself and my friend, who I conned into also dropping everything and going, so the tickets were now guaranteed, as long as we showed up between 3:00-4:00 PM the day of the taping and we had photo ID. There wasn't any threat of flying all the way out there and not having tickets. So, now I've got tickets, but being in Kansas City, I had to figure out how to get there. Having never been to New York, we sprang for the earliest flight there and the latest flight home to maximize our time in NYC. So, we flew into LaGuardia and took the E train to the Ed Sullivan Theater, got in line at 3:00 PM, where we were led into the theater to get our tickets. Showed the photo ID and we got our tickets. They normally tape at 4:30, but this day Bill Clinton was one of the guests and they moved the taping back an hour to accommodate schedules. So, we were told to leave the theater and come back at 4:50 to get into another line to actually get in for the show. So, Times Square is actually about 10 blocks away, so it was a no-brainer to hang out there, grab a bite and a drink and just people watch while we waited. We went back and got some Late Show gear at the Hello Deli, around the corner from the theater, and got a photo taken with the owner, Rupert Jee. We got in the 4:50 PM line and were actually led into the theater. I read on previous Trip Advisor reviews that they make you check bags and cell phones, but they didn't do either to us. They just ask that phones are turned completely off (so, no photos allowed inside the theater), and they do have numerous pages running around before, during and after the taping in the audience looking to tell people to put their phones away, so unfortunately, I couldn't get away with taking photos inside the theater. There doesn't seem to be a method on how they seat you--some people in our line went down to the floor, some went up into the balcony. We happened to sit in the balcony, which bummed us out at first, but we heard the view is much better up there because all the cameras aren't in the way like they would be downstairs. The taping itself was great...before the show started, announcer Alan Kalter warmed up the crowd, the CBS Orchestra played a couple of numbers, Paul Shaffer was brought out to a huge ovation and then Dave himself came out to take questions from the audience for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 5:45 PM, the show started, and it's just like what you see on TV, except now you get to see what happens during the commercial breaks. Most breaks Dave got up and went backstage only to return a few seconds before coming back on the air to host the next segment. The band plays throughout the entire commercial and they really did sound great. The guests were Bill Clinton and Adam Sandler for Dave's 7th to last show. The Ed Sullivan Theater really looks much larger on TV...even though we sat in the balcony, you felt like you were only 100 feet away from Dave and the stage. The taping was over at about 6:45 PM. With the show taping an hour later than we originally were planning for, we had to hustle and get a cab (instead of a train) to get to Newark to fly out at 8:30 PM. We made it home to Kansas City by 10:30 PM, so it was a 17-hour crazy adventure that cost an arm and a leg, but to be able to now say that I got to see Dave in person on his second-to-last week, that's pretty priceless!", "ReviewerNumReviews": "5", "ReviewType": "Couples", "ReviewHelpful": "7", "ReviewerLocationState": "MO", "ReviewerAge": " 35-49 year old male ", "ReviewerPhotos": "", "ReviewURL": "https://www.tripadvisor.com//ShowUserReviews-g60763-d555916-r271950761-The_Late_Show_with_David_Letterman-New_York_City_New_York.html#REVIEWS", "ReviewerPoints": "517", "ClassType": "Dance", "ReviewPicture": "No", "ReviewNumPic": 0, "ReviewerNumHelpful": "17", "ReviewerLevelContrib": "02", "ReviewMobile": "No", "ReviewTitle": "A whirlwind adventure", "ReviewerLocationCity": "Kansas City", "ProviderLocation": "Ed Sullivan Theater, 1697 Broadway, between 53rd and 54th Sts , New York City , NY", "ReviewerSince": " Jul 2010", "PointsRate": "5"}, {"ReviewerName": "Iskender83", "ProviderName": "The Late Show with David Letterman\n- CLOSED", "DateVisited": "12/01", "ReviewDate": "None found", "ReviewText": "I love that show and when I was in front of Ed Sullivan theatre it was great.

I suggest going to the Courtyard by Marriott on the next block North and wait in the lounge on the 4th floor. The restrooms there are nice and clean... no hassle.

A couple weeks before traveling to NYC to finish out mortuary school I had applied online for tickets. A few days before arriving in town I received a call from The Late Show promotions department offering two tickets. Needless to say I was ecstatic. The problem I ran into was that my classes for the day our tickets were for, Tuesday, were not to let out until 3pm. The LS staff needed us there before 3. The theater was just a few blocks from my school. Needless to say the school said there would be no early dismissal. Regrettably I had to pass on the tickets. Here's where it gets good; when Tuesday rolled around, I of course, went to my classes. At 2:15 the instructor said unexpectedly, \"Ok, that's it, see everyone tomorrow\" I sat stunned. I quickly ran out of the building, caught a cab down to the Port Authority to meet up with my wife, caught another cab; and made a mad dash to the Ed Sullivan Theater. We were told that we could be placed on a \"standby\" list for tickets if any would be left for the evening's show. Long and the short of it; we waited around the corner with a group of people, all hoping to get it ... We GOT IN!! #36 & 37 of 39. Our seats were in the last row in the upper left of the balcony right above the sound board for the orchestra. Could not see Paul Shaffer, but we knew he was there. We had a \"reasonable\" view of the set and of course Dave. Billy Crystal and Connie Chen were Dave's guest.
