They are no.18, ‘Abraham Lincoln and his Father Building their Cabin on Pigeon Creek’ (1934); no. 22 ‘Christ and the Woman of Samaria’ (1940); and no. 24 ‘Supper Time’ (1940). Who was Horace Pippin to elicit such interest from Dr. Barnes? Dr. Barnes had a long-standing interest in African and African-American art. He met Pippin, a self-taught, modest man through the Philadelphia art dealer Robert Carlen who also had dealings with Dr. Barnes. Pippin had been in the French trenches during WWI and, after a disabling injury to his shoulder, returned to Pennsylvania. His illustrated war diaries became an early inspiration for his art and to help with his post-war ”blues.” Holding his disabled arm with his left hand, and working painstakingly slowly, he finished his first oil painting, ‘The End of War: Starting Home’, in 1929. Robert Carlen later donated it to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1940 Carlen mounted Pippin’s first exhibition in his Philadelphia gallery, and Dr. Barnes wrote the introduction to the catalogue, as he also did for Pippin’s second show in 1942. Dr. Barnes who had earlier acquired ‘Abraham Lincoln etc.’ now also purchased ‘Supper Time’ and ‘Christ and the Woman of Samaria.’ Dr. Barnes called Pippin an American original in whose paintings the rhythms of African-American spirituals resonated. But the relationship between Pippin and Dr. Barnes soon took a downturn. As Pippin became better known and the prices for his paintings escalated, Dr. Barnes insisted on the price paid for earlier paintings. Pippin’s dealer did not agree.

On a recent trip to Philadelphia, I put visiting The Barnes Foundation at the top of my to-do list. I have no argument with the decision to move the collection and in general I liked the new building. But I did not experience the joy I almost always feel in museums, large or small, when I am surrounded by great works of art. Part of that was due to the fact that so many of the pieces need cleaning. That was depressing. There were individual pieces that I loved, and one certainly has a chance to study certain artists, particularly Cezanne, Renoir and Matisse, in some depth. For me it was particularly interesting to see how Renoir created many variations on the same idea and how some works were so intriguing while others were immediately forgettable. But the experience of moving from room to room was almost like being in an ""art for sale"" warehouse. Adding to this feeling was the fact that many of those around me were moving through the museum like they were part of a tour group on a tight schedule, determined to lay eyes on everything but really see nothing. Perhaps the sheer volume of the collection makes this happen as one Renoir after another after another after another induces a sort of trance. I have never had this feeling before in an art museum. As I am a frequent visitor to the Gardner Museum in Boston, I am sympathetic to museums that display their collections as their founders intended and have multiple pieces displayed in close proximity and oddly configured. It works at the Gardner but doesn't at the Barnes. Other reviewers have advised reading up on the history of the Barnes collection and the artists it highlights. I think that is very wise advice for this particular museum. I am glad I saw the collection which is, indeed, amazing. I am just sorry that the overall experience was so dispiriting.",Solo,,Massachusetts,Dance,Boston,NA,No,03/11,Underwhelmed

Time for the youngsters to learn and the older generation to remember. Located on Independence Mall across the street from the National Constitution Center and a short walk away from Independence Hall one is instantly reminded that Jewish participation in the life of the United States of America is far reaching and deep. It is best to begin one’s exploration with Foundations of Freedom (1654-1880) on the fourth floor. This was a time of expansion and growth on the American continent and thus a natural destination for those trying to escape from social, including religious, political and economic turmoil on the European and especially the central European continent. It is appropriate to remember that the Liberty Bell, the symbol of American independence and freedom, traveled to America from its English foundry on the ship of the Jewish merchant Nathan Levy. Dreams of Freedom (1880-1945) on the 3rd floor documents the attempts of immigrants, Jewish or otherwise, to preserve their heritage and traditions while trying to integrate themselves into their new world. Choices and Challenges of Freedom (1945-Today) on the 2nd floor includes the post-WWII fight for civil rights, women’s equality and support for the new State of Israel. “Only in America” is the topic of the changing video panorama on the main floor where you make the acquaintance of such distinguished Jewish-American personalities as Jonas Salk (the end of polio), Justice Brandeis after whom a distinguished university is named, Golda Meir (Prime Minister of Israel), Betty Friedan, Jerome Robbins, Saul Bellow, Estee Lauder and many, many others who have made substantial contributions to American public life. And yes, as the banners outside the museum proclaim, you will also see the first movie camera of the film genius Steven Spielberg, Irving Berlin’s piano and Albert Einstein’s pipe.

It was great fun and reinforced one’s impression that Benjamin Franklin was a man for his times who could wear many hats at the same time. The Museum on 3rd and 4th Sts, and Chestnut and Market Sts felt like a playground for the young and curious. Did you know that Franklin was not only a seasoned diplomat and political and civic mastermind but also a curious tinkerer and can rightly be called the godfather to a number of our modern conveniences. He channeled the intricacies of electricity to our benefit; he invented a collapsible stepladder that could be folded to serve as a chair for reading the book retrieved from the top shelf with bifocals he also invented. There is much, much more to learn, and one can spend hours marveling at the mind and the ingenuity of this man who did not hesitate to use a number of pen names when it felt convenient. The Museum is adjacent to the restored site of the Market Street Houses where Franklin, his family and other families lived for a time. The houses don’t exist any longer and their value as real estate led to their sale in the early 19th century. But a “Ghost House” frame marks their location, and a clever architectural design lets you look below to follow the original foundations. Pavement stones provide further details. Do take a look at the wall display near the print shop to learn how Philadelphia expanded during the 18th century. And yes, the owner and inhabitants of these houses did have human needs to take care of and so, for example, you find a marker suggesting that the privy of the Franklin family was located here, and that a nearby water well was shared by various resident families. Philadelphia history has many twists and turns, but you can leave it to Benjamin Franklin and his Museum to explain these to you.

If you want to see those ancient arts, you need to visit the Penn Museum. I am very impressed by its Chinese collections, especially the two stone horse reliefs which was part of the six stone horse relief commissioned by Emperor Tang Taizong of in 636 CE. I can hardly understate the importance of Emperor Tang Taizong in Chinese history. Let me put it this way: few Chinese have heard of all the Chinese emperors; however, almost all of them have heard of Tang Taizong. In fact, his dynasty (Tang) is the reason why today we still call Chinatowns all over the world as the ""streets of the Tang people"". Back to the story of the stone horse reliefs: the six reliefs were portraits of the beloved war-horses of Tang Taizong, and they stood right at his tomb for almost 1000 years after his death. Two of them can now be seen in the Penn Museum ! My suggestion: don't miss them for the world ! The Penn Museum has an operating lab you can see as well. When I was there, a mummy was being worked on and was placed on a table in the middle of the office. Note that the Penn Museum is rather weak on modern art.

The ground-level floor features two permanent exhibitions on actual history: first a room that showcases a movie about William Penn, and Philadelphia's and Pennsylvania's foundation providing a detailed story, a large floor-map of the center of Philadelphia, and a composition of photos from the past and the present; second a room with a timeline which gives a rough insight into Philadelphia's history after that. The third room houses changing exhibitions, I assume, always about a volunteer organisation that influences the community (the museum store has published a book about that topic, available there, I think). When I was there on November 28, this room's exhibition was about an art project for children and youths with latin american social background, called Taller Puertorriquen~a (please read this symbol ~ above the 'n'). I as a tourist found this exhibition very interesting, the social effects of this program gave me a very deep insight into art and its meanings, possibilities, and potential. The complete second floor features another permanent exhibition about objects and the (hi)story/stories they tell. It is basically a large collection of different objects (like the boxing gloves of a famous Philadelphian boxer, Benjamin Franklin's fireglass, a grandfather clock of another famous (late) citizen of Philadelphia). To each object its original, encyclical definition/description and use, the real story that is known that it tells, and the piece of Philadelphian history covered by/connected to that, is given. Furthermore, the question is asked what other stories the object on hand might tell, along with a few examplatory answers. Although I had not the time to see everything (I had ""only"" a 10 hour layover in Philadelphia), I found this museum very intriguing (and definitely worth the $10 charged for adults).

I also discovered Horace Pippin (1888-1946), the self-taught, deeply human African-American artist who served in France during WW I. He is one of the very few participants in this exhibit who served and therefore can speak with particular urgency and candor. Pippin was deeply scarred by his war experiences and, with his right arm wounded and crippled for life, Pippin was dispatched home in 1919, to an uncertain emotional and material existence. It was not until the mid-1930s that he returned to modest attempts at painting, inventing ways to use his crippled arm. By picking up paint and brush again he hoped to combat his frequent “blue spells” that had troubled his memory and psyche for so long. Two pictures in this exhibit are poignant testimonies to his experiences. They are “End of War: Starting Home” worked on between 1930-33; and “Barracks,” painted in 1945. In their simple forms and with an intuitive sense of dignity, color, proportion and essentials of story telling Pippin was eventually able to silence his demons and move on. Pippin became a well known African American painter with solo shows in major museums and paintings of various genres in public and private collections. He remained a modest man to the end of his life, devoted to his family as well as his God. He died where he had been born, in Chester, Pennsylvania, a short distance from Philadelphia. He always painted with the same motivation: “Pictures come to my head and I tell my heart to go ahead.” World War I and American Art will be at PAFA until April 9, 2017.",Solo,523,Pennsylvania,Dance,Philadelphia,NA,No,06/15,World War I and American Art: Horace Pippin

At least my daughters would assert so. I grew up in the 50s. and yes one of my favorite Christmas presents was a chemistry set which grew into a ""chemistry corner"" in the garage. There my buddies and I made rocket fuel and other noxious substances. Sputnik came along and suddenly kids who could do some science got a lot of encouragement. Went to college as a biochemistry major, ended up a double major in history and biology, and landed in medicine. My wife's background is also in science: first marine science and then health care. We could have spent half a day in this museum but even those without a science background will find enough here to be entertained for an hour or two, and smile or laugh more than once in the process. The museum is in the historic district and a short walk down Chestnut from Independence Hall. There is no admission fee, but you are asked to answer a few questions on a computer so the Foundation will have an idea what kinds of people walk through their door. The museum has two parts: a permanent collection featuring historical experimental equipment and video instructional material and a rotating exhibit which was featuring alchemy when we visited. The museum is airy and modern on the interior with staff that can help you find an exhibit that will appeal to your interests. For example, interested in fashion: there are exhibits dealing with the chemistry and development of dyes and synthetic fibers and cloth. Interested in health: how about one of the first NMR (MRI) machines. Too small to get inside and feel claustrophobic, they used small beach clams as subjects, and complete with the typewriter written note taped on the front (This machine is prone to fail at critical moments, do not panic). How about some complex three dimensional models of life-critical proteins complete with the story of how the gummy bears failed to hold the tooth picks representing bonds together in the initial model. Do all chemist enjoy a little well-contained explosion? You bet. Check out the giant video screen of the periodic table and press on sodium for a video of the ""sodium party"" where a remote control (read string stretched to shore) releases a piece of sodium into a bucket of water on a raft in a lake, to dramatic pyrotechnic effect. While you're there check out a few elements you've never heard off. It's a strange and fascinating world we live in. If your background is science, this little gem of a museum is well worth a detour.
