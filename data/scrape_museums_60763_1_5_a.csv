For instance, I like the American Wing, the Egyptian temple room, the Impressionists, and Modern Art. All of that takes about 3 - 4 hours. After that I'm ready to check out the Museum gift shop.

I was going to New York City for a wedding and decided to book two of their tours. I heard about Museum Hack from social media and through work. I started off Friday morning with The American Museum of Natural History: Un-Highlights Tour. I have only been to this museum once before on a class trip from Florida. Evan was our guide and his colleague Dustin joined us. This was fast paced insanity from start to finish and I loved every second of it. Evan is very good at engaging even the most dull material to an audience. He knows what he is doing and is a snappy dresser. I learned so much. My only complaint is that I wish the tour was longer. That evening I did The Metropolitan Museum of Art: V.I.P. Tour. I have never been to The Met and was mesmerized from the moment I walked in. The tour was 3 hours long but again, loved every second of it. Our guide was Anna and her co-guide Lindsey. Both very knowledgeable, hilarious, and full of energy. This is another fast pace tour and you have to be paying attention to where you're going, it's easy to get lost if you don't know the museum(I guess that's why they have 2 guides)! Overall these guides live up to the company's reputation. It was a genuine experience and I would recommend this tour to everyone, seasoned museum goers and newbies. I visit NYC a few times a year, I will be back and will be taking the rest of their tours and probably repeating these. It's worth every penny.

The collection in the museum is vast and impressive, but I was especially moved by the photos and quotes of Native Americans, people filled with wisdom of, and reverence for, the natural world, and who were condemned to dismissal or even death as ""savages"" by the European interlopers. Listen, for example, to the words of Sunka Luta of the Oglala Dakota from a speech he gave in NYC in June 1870: ""When the Great Father [the U.S. President at the time] first sent out men to our people I was poor and thin; now I am large and fat.

But they usually tell the same. However, this museum was well concieved. Indeed, you will discover Jew's history through 3 floors, first telling you more about their traditions, religious celebration, everyday life, etc. The second floor will explore how Jews passed through WWII, their personal stories, how those who survived managed to leave Germany or Europe, etc. Finally, you will find out what became of the jewish culture around the world after WWII. From the start, I have learned many things I ignored. When we learn about WWII in Europe, we rarely talk about Jew people appart from ""they were the main target"". This museum brings you closer to this culture and offers a great understanding of what their believes are. I also discovered a part of history I never heard about, giving incentive on how the victims lived through this terrible part of human history. If you really want to discover the entire museum, it took me about 3 hours. Thus, if you have a rainy day, it is the perfect moment to jump into history! If you don't want to read the pannels, you can ask for an audio guide (these are compatible with your personal earpods) for free, you will only need to leave an id as a ""deposit"". For people who wonder about kids visiting the place, I saw a class with very young kids visiting the place with a guided tour. This may be the most appropriate way to get them to lear about this event if you do not know how to talk about the topic to your child. Note that before entering the place, you will go through a check in (like in the airport). I definitely recommend this museum!",Solo,21,5,Switzerland,,0,0,01/15

My main issue is the limited information on Native Americans, the first migrants of the land.

Folk and Self Taught artists have a way of cutting down to the heart of the matter when they create works of art. They create out of necessity, not thinking about style or how the work will be received. Most of the time it is the externalization of emotional need, not so different from other artists with the exception of the lack of aesthetic and ego concerns created by the formal art establishments.The latest exhibition ""Securing the Shadow: Posthumous Portraiture in America"", juxtaposes an eclectic array of images of the departed. Included among a number of other singular objects is a cast death mask of a child. A few early American trained artists including the famed Charles Wilson Peale are also included in the show. There is also a room focused on numerous emotion filled postmortem daguerreotypes of mothers posing with their infants. In the early years of photography such images ultimately became portable and carried with the surviving loved one. They became meditations of ""forget me not”. The main focus of the exhibition is on the Mortuary Portraits by self taught artists. They are indeed strangely wonderful. Somehow we know the subject or subjects of the paintings are dead. The paintings look Surrealistic. The exhibition makes us think about how we remember. I returned to New York to see this exhibition after seeing two exhibitions this summer that really knocked me out. ""Fever Within:The Art of Ronald Lockett & the companion exhibition ""Once Something Has Lived it Can Never Really Die”.I knew nothing about this artist who tragically died young but that exhibition was one of the most moving shows I have seen in recent memory.

Sadly, the Neue Gallerie was closed on the day of my visit, but the METBREUER, the former Whitney now affiliated with THEMET, complemented the minimalist art at the Guggenheim with a stunningly installed Diane Arbus photography exhibit and a thoughtful review of Paul Klee (1879-1940), a member of the influential Bauhaus of the 1920s in Germany and a multi-faceted artist in his own right. The Asia Society Museum features the Chinese-French artist Zao Wou-Ki (1920-2013) (to January 8, 2017) and his dazzling colors in oil paintings and works on paper. And, indeed, the stately Frick and the humongously diverse METMUSEUM never disappoint in their attention to artistic tradition at the Frick, and, in the case of the MET, to balancing its permanent collections in permanent galleries with current exhibitions such as the drawings of Fragonard (to January 8, 2017), paintings by Max Beckman (to February 20, 2017), to Jerusalem 1000-1400, Every People Under Heaven (to January 8, 2017), and many more.
