Evan was our guide and his colleague Dustin joined us. This was fast paced insanity from start to finish and I loved every second of it. Evan is very good at engaging even the most dull material to an audience. He knows what he is doing and is a snappy dresser. I learned so much. My only complaint is that I wish the tour was longer. That evening I did The Metropolitan Museum of Art: V.I.P. Tour. I have never been to The Met and was mesmerized from the moment I walked in. The tour was 3 hours long but again, loved every second of it. Our guide was Anna and her co-guide Lindsey. Both very knowledgeable, hilarious, and full of energy. This is another fast pace tour and you have to be paying attention to where you're going, it's easy to get lost if you don't know the museum(I guess that's why they have 2 guides)! Overall these guides live up to the company's reputation. It was a genuine experience and I would recommend this tour to everyone, seasoned museum goers and newbies.

But they usually tell the same. However, this museum was well concieved. Indeed, you will discover Jew's history through 3 floors, first telling you more about their traditions, religious celebration, everyday life, etc. The second floor will explore how Jews passed through WWII, their personal stories, how those who survived managed to leave Germany or Europe, etc. Finally, you will find out what became of the jewish culture around the world after WWII. From the start, I have learned many things I ignored. When we learn about WWII in Europe, we rarely talk about Jew people appart from ""they were the main target"". This museum brings you closer to this culture and offers a great understanding of what their believes are. I also discovered a part of history I never heard about, giving incentive on how the victims lived through this terrible part of human history. If you really want to discover the entire museum, it took me about 3 hours. Thus, if you have a rainy day, it is the perfect moment to jump into history! If you don't want to read the pannels, you can ask for an audio guide (these are compatible with your personal earpods) for free, you will only need to leave an id as a ""deposit"". For people who wonder about kids visiting the place, I saw a class with very young kids visiting the place with a guided tour. This may be the most appropriate way to get them to lear about this event if you do not know how to talk about the topic to your child.

Folk and Self Taught artists have a way of cutting down to the heart of the matter when they create works of art. They create out of necessity, not thinking about style or how the work will be received. Most of the time it is the externalization of emotional need, not so different from other artists with the exception of the lack of aesthetic and ego concerns created by the formal art establishments.The latest exhibition ""Securing the Shadow: Posthumous Portraiture in America"", juxtaposes an eclectic array of images of the departed. Included among a number of other singular objects is a cast death mask of a child. A few early American trained artists including the famed Charles Wilson Peale are also included in the show. There is also a room focused on numerous emotion filled postmortem daguerreotypes of mothers posing with their infants. In the early years of photography such images ultimately became portable and carried with the surviving loved one. They became meditations of ""forget me not”. The main focus of the exhibition is on the Mortuary Portraits by self taught artists. They are indeed strangely wonderful. Somehow we know the subject or subjects of the paintings are dead. The paintings look Surrealistic. The exhibition makes us think about how we remember. I returned to New York to see this exhibition after seeing two exhibitions this summer that really knocked me out. ""Fever Within:The Art of Ronald Lockett & the companion exhibition ""Once Something Has Lived it Can Never Really Die”.I knew nothing about this artist who tragically died young but that exhibition was one of the most moving shows I have seen in recent memory.

The place was chock full of small children running around. On top of that, I don’t think 99% of the children had any idea of what 90% percent of the exhibits were about. Many of the exhibits had little or no written explanation of their purpose. As an adult, I couldn’t even figure out what several of these inadequately described exhibits were supposed to illustrate or teach in the way of math or math history. So I have absolutely no idea how a child, or even a parent trying to help out a child, would learn anything much in this Museum. At the very back of the first floor was one small room that had brief descriptions of historical figures and their contriutions. Even this exhibit, however, was off kilter.

I thought $12 admission (that's the senior rate) was high but anticipated a top notch tour based on reviews here. Our experience did not match. From the ho-hum greeting when we entered (the male was looking at his phone, the female reading something), to the lackluster ending (""Well, that's it."" ) we were disappointed. As we paid, one of the two staff asked ""Are you here for the tour?"" and told us we could look around. After waiting a few minutes, we sat in some of the assorted mismatched chairs that were in the second room. The exhibits were interesting but amateurish in the arrangement and display. Glass on the display cases was dirty with visible fingerprints in many places. The male guide began the tour holding a batch of papers in his hand. I assume it was his script. He had a soft voice with little emphasis, and a slight accent so was a little difficult to follow. He did explain his connection to the museum and mentioned that many of the early beer producers came from his home country, Germany. When he concluded, the other guide took over and led us to the other room to view various photos and displays as she talked. The female guide talked non stop, and fast, so fast you could not process one bit of information as she went to a new topic. She also interjected a noticeable amount of personal opinion and political commentary that was not relevant to the topic. After 40 minutes of standing and listening, I had to sit down and moved to the back of the group to one of the chairs. The narrative continued, and the information was interesting but so rapid I was relieved when the other guide came back! We moved into another portion of the building, the bar area. A bar patron came in behind the tour group and was audibly irritated that the tour was there. We stood for several more minutes of soft spoken information that was hard to hear. There was a brief commercial/pitch for hotdogs being sold and the guide resumed the tour. The hot dog commentary was well done but a definite pitch for product sales. We put on plastic hard hats and descended to the ""secret"" area of the building and heard some more details. The stories were good but I was dismayed that the area was so dirty and jumbled with miscellaneous storage and stuff. Going down the stairs the area was dirty with accumulated fingerprints and grease and general stains. There were storage bins with hand written signs on storing used liquor bottles, etc from the upstairs bar. The tour moved from one area to a smaller area that not everyone could fit into. The guide said for part of us to come in and that he would explain the information again. I moved into the smaller room for a while, then stepped back out so others could enter. At the end of his talk, he ended with ""Well, that's it"" and didn't repeat any of the information for the others who were not in the smaller area.

The jewel of Fifth Avenue’s “Museum Mile” is The Metropolitan Museum of Art—“The Met”—perhaps the greatest art museum in the world, where art is displayed beautifully. From impressionist paintings, computer art to medieval suits of armor and to Chinese and Japanese silk and jade, The Met has an unrivaled collection that is accessible to all, often with audio guides in several languages. It is an especially great way to spend two to six hours on a hot or rainy day, and it has several good places to eat and rest. Suggested admission fee is $25 per adult, but you can pay less, and there are some other ways to enjoy lower rates (see below) Currently the Met is showing a great exhibit on clothing—Manus X Machina: Fashion in the Age of Technology: fantastic clothing made by hand and by machine. The exhibit is at The Met Fifth Avenue at 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd to 84th street. Ten blocks away at The Jewish Museum at 93rd street, there is a great exhibit on fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, his clothes and his impact on the fashion industry. The exhibit also includes several great film clips of Mizrahi. The Jewish Museum has a nice downstairs fish-oriented kosher deli for a good bite and drink. In between the Met and The Jewish Museum is the Guggenheim Museum on 88th Street and Fifth, which has some great modern art exhibits such as the works of Kandinsky. Nearby is the Cooper Hewitt Museum of Design which has a $16 on-line ticket price (or 18 in person) or $10 if you are 62 years or older. Under 18 years old is for free, and students above 18 pay seven dollars. The Cooper-Hewitt Museum has a nice café garden. For those who want to investigate these and some of the other museums in great depth, here is a quick summary of some of them: • El Museo del Barrio at 104th Street • Museum of the City of New York at 103rd Street • Jewish Museum at 92nd Street • Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design at 91st Street • National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts at 89th Street • Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum at 88th Street • Metropolitan Museum of Art from 82nd to 86th Streets • Goethe House German Cultural Center at 82nd Street • Neue Gallery at 86th Street has a great collection of German-Austrian art, and it has a charming cafe, but admission is expensive and the waiting lines can be killers. Saving money on Museum Mile is always relevant. Check out the various NY Pass and City Pass packages that offer discounts. The problem with them is that you get a one-time only shot at a museum, and with the Met, in particular, that is a shame, because the Met has a huge series of collect.

By then it might be time for a late lunch in the bright Garden Court Cafe at the Asia Society Museum. Just crossing two avenues west, the stately Frick at 70th and Fifth never disappoints, and a couple of long blocks north is the Metropolitan Museum, now THEMET, with its great variety of exhibits, shops, dining opportunities and more, that speak to every creative age of mankind. At the Guggenheim the minimalist artist Agnes Martin retrospective (to January 11, 2017) fascinates, making its last stop here after an extended European and America tour. Sadly, the Neue Gallerie was closed on the day of my visit, but the METBREUER, the former Whitney now affiliated with THEMET, complemented the minimalist art at the Guggenheim with a stunningly installed Diane Arbus photography exhibit and a thoughtful review of Paul Klee (1879-1940), a member of the influential Bauhaus of the 1920s in Germany and a multi-faceted artist in his own right. The Asia Society Museum features the Chinese-French artist Zao Wou-Ki (1920-2013) (to January 8, 2017) and his dazzling colors in oil paintings and works on paper. And, indeed, the stately Frick and the humongously diverse METMUSEUM never disappoint in their attention to artistic tradition at the Frick, and, in the case of the MET, to balancing its permanent collections in permanent galleries with current exhibitions such as the drawings of Fragonard (to January 8, 2017), paintings by Max Beckman (to February 20, 2017), to Jerusalem 1000-1400, Every People Under Heaven (to January 8, 2017), and many more.
