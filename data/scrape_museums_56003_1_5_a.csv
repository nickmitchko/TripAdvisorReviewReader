One of the two that I selected was the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum located on Caroline Street. I like military history and I personally found this museum interesting. The museum is located in an old armory building that has an interesting character to it. The displays within contain a rich history of the African American military experience in our country’s great wars, including WW II, WW 1, the Spanish American War, and even going back to the Revolutionary War. Artifacts have been collected from different time periods and it is interesting to view them and read about them (clothing, rifle’s, swords, etc.) The displays are a bit plain but tell a story, and one that is important. Here is some history to ponder: It was in the year 1866 by an act of congress, that legislation was adopted to form six all African American military regiments. Two were Cavalry units and four were infantry regiments. These men of color would represent the first Black “Professional Soldiers” in a peacetime army.

The museum's website gives the correct location at 8611 Wallisville Road. The staff there commented on the fact that people are always going to the wrong location. This place was easy to pass by. I had noticed the military trucks parked in an enclosed area, but didn't see a sign for the museum, so drove by it and had to turn around further down Wallisville Road. The signs for it are small - one on the building itself and one beside the gate to the enclosed area. Also, the entrance to the parking area was partially which caused some 2nd thoughts about if this was the right place. We did turn into the parking area and walked up the steps to the doorway. There was a sign that stated ""We may be in back, so call xxx-xxx-xxxx for assistance"". However, I saw someone through the door and he was waving us into the building. This turned out to be their Chaplain, who took our money and started the tour for us. He had been about to run out for a food run, but saw us and so came to help us. This is an all volunteer organization (mostly for hobby purposes it seems) which does not have regularly scheduled tours, but stop what they are doing to give on-the-spot tours for anyone who comes in. They do make pre-scheduled tour times for large groups. All the volunteers that we met were prior military and were wearing uniforms. Chaplain Kelley started the tour in a room full of military memorabilia that members and other people loaned to the museum for this purpose. He talked about plans to make it better to view, such as having the photo albums scanned in to view online, but they aren't there yet. He was able to point out almost all the objects and give some type of talk about it. One of the photo albums was opened to a page of battleship pictures prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor. I would have liked to view that album more. The next room displayed a lot of various uniforms with some patterns that I had not seen before. Again, he was very knowledgeable in the time periods represented by the uniforms except for the one that I hadn't seen previously. He wasn't sure where it had came from. About this time, he received a call from his wife, so at the recommendation of the museum's President, LTC Farris, he took us back to the maintenance area and passed us off to Tim Minor (?) who had been working on one of the trucks getting it ready for an event next weekend. Chaplain Kelley said goodbye to us at this point. We were shown around the maintenance area and Tim was very knowledgeable about the different vehicles and pointed out several features of most of them. He then took us back inside and went through each of the vehicle displays there. It was very obvious he enjoys working here and has a lot of interesting stories about the group. When we finished up, before Tim walked us out to the front, LTC Farris dropped by again to see how we enjoyed our tour. This museum is not as large as other military museums that we have visited around the country, but it definitely makes up for the size with the personal interaction that the volunteers provide. From questioning them, it seems that they spend a lot of their own money and time in a lot of the vehicles they have around the museum. Some had been provided by the military, but they are always looking for more in auctions and on the internet. They were fun to interact with and brought back a lot of memories with their stories. The tour took about an hour, though the website states to allocate 1.5 to 2 hours for tours. I didn't see a gift area. The museum is only open for tours from Wednesday through Sunday of each week. There was a sign, where we paid admission, that stated credit card purchases for over $20 only.

I wish we had this in Cleveland, OH. For only $6 per person you get to see a nice collection of uniforms and firearms on display in three rooms that are approx. a total of 600 square feet from WWII-current. The rooms are all air conditioned. We had a veteran give my wife and I a tour of the facility. Then we were taken into the warehouse section of the museum where lots of vehicles are kept, everything from jeeps, to APCs, helicopters, to a boat that are in operating condition. As our guide even mentioned, if it is leaking oil then it is an operational vehicle, you could see the oil leaks being collected under the vehicles. Things are opened up for you to actually get a look inside. With the tour guide giving details of the reconditioning that each vehicle has received and if it was an actual vehicle from WWII or others or a model that was built shortly after the war and was painted in the wars scheme. Our tour guide also informed us that the staff and vehicles were used not only for parades but for reenactments in the area. I will have to come back sometime and see one. We also got to see the vehicles stored outside of the warehouse. They could use a bigger warehouse to protect all of the vehicles. We got to see the vehicles that were also going through various reconditioning, even one they had freshly painted before we arrived. We could smell the fresh paint as we were walking around the vehicle. Also the museum maintains a schedule of times it is opened. When we showed up everyone was in the warehouse, but there was a note on the door to call and someone would come and let us in, which they did promptly. I am glad we found this place. After leaving, both my wife and I agreed we should give a donation as this is a great facility and the entry fee doesn't cover the amount of work this museum has done. This is also a great place to come and talk to and hear the stories from veterans: I would highly recommend for teens and adults to come and hear the history from those that were there. I will be writing a letter to the History Channel as this would be a great place to get the true story from veterans who were there and are willing to share.

The rooms were a little small but they were still very nice. The employees that worked in valet, housekeeping, room service, concierge desk and at the hotel shuttle service were exceptional! There was one young man at the front desk that checked me out that was really good as well. I enjoyed my stay because of them. However their are some areas that need improvement. I called the hotel about three times before my stay to ask questions so I could be prepared before I got there. The three times I called the person on the phone seemed annoyed by my questions. I booked my stay on trip advisor and its was my first time using a third party to book my hotel reservations. The second time I called I asked about any extra fees that I may need to be prepared to pay. I was transferred to reservations and they told me since I had booked on trip advisor whatever fee I was charged on the site should be all I needed. I was like ok because I know most hotels like this charge fees for every night you stay to cover any charges you might make, the incidental fee. I made sure I had about 100 extra plus my room fee and gas money just in case. After an 8 hour and 30 minute drive I rolled into the hotel excited about my stay, I was going to see the Beyonce concert the next day. I'm in Texas working on special assignment with my job until January and I also wanted to see more of what the state had to offer. Upon arrival I was told that because I was paying with my debit card that had I had to pay a $200 incidental fee up front. I told the young lady that I called ahead about extra fees and I wasn't told about this. I told her I only had a little over $600 on my debit card and that I could transfer the room fee over to one of my credit cards to get around the debit card upfront charge. She went and got the manger that was working that night. They both come out and the manger said because she said your really nice we are going to charge you for the stay on your card tonight and you can give us another card for your incidentals. I was like if I give you a credit card will I still need to pay the $200 fee upfront she said yes. I was confused because I thought I needed to pay the fee upfront because I was paying with a debit card. I was panicking inside trying to figure out what I could do because I wasn't going to have any extra money until I was paid on Friday. While I was thinking the manger started asking was I excited for the concert. I was like well I was and she proceeded to tell me that she could have told me me no that that would accept my card. She also added that my rooms were really discounted and I got a bunch of extra stuff since I booked on trip advisor. I was taken aback. Who in there right mind is going to to be excited for a concert when they are faced with the possibility that they won't have anywhere to stay for the next three days. The way she spoke to me was like I should be grateful that I even had the opportunity to stay there. How dare you! I agreed to letting them put the room balance on my card and using another card for my incidentals. The young lady said she tried to run my card twice and it wouldn't go through. I called my bank and talked to them and they said there was never an attempt to run my card made. I walked back up to the desk and told the young lady what my bank had said while they were on the phone and miraculously my card worked. I was calling bull crap on that one. I don't believe she ever ran it like my bank said. While I had my bank on the phone I told them what was happening and they agreed to raise the credit limit on a credit card I had with them so that I didn't have to use my spending money on the incidentals. So it worked out in the end but that whole check in experience pissed me off since I had called to inquire about extra fees and the way the manger talked to me was out of line. I would love to say I would stay here again but I probably won't because of this incident.",Solo,,Virginia,Dance,Charlottesville,NA,Yes,05/16,Nice hotel but I had an issue with the way I was treated at check in

I had planned to spend an hour here based on the museum's website. There is metered parking along Caroline St., of if available, free curb parking on Palm Street next to the museum. The sign in front of the museum is not easily seen until you are passing the museum, but there is a small brown road sign pointing to the museum in the median. The admission desk is to the left after entering the museum. A few gifts can be bought here, but it is really a small selection. The admission cost $5 each adult for a self-guided tour. The website had mentioned a guided tour that could be scheduled in advance with a meteorologist for $8 each and would last 45-60 minutes; that would be the best choice. There is not a lot of information for each exhibit, but you do get a handout that describes what each room is supposed to be. The first room is a studio that can be used, with the help of museum personnel, to record a weather forecast. It was up and running, so we stood in front of the camera and watched ourselves on the television and monitor provided. The second room had to do with climate zones. They basically have aquariums set up as different environments with reptiles or fish in them. The cyclone room had an exhibit about emergency supplies in case of a hurricane and some satellite and radar photos. There were some hands-on weather experiments and a small tornado chamber further on. Another room discussed the history of weather forecasting and a small video room was set up for showing DVDs. The one playing while we were there was on Hurricane Ike. I think you would get a lot more out of it if you had a meteorologist explaining the various exhibits. We ended up staying there less than 30 minutes. We could have sat and watched the DVD for a while, but decided not to. If you are really interested in weather, then it may be a good place to stop by for a little while. Otherwise, I would recommend only going with a group with a guide.

I planned and booked to have my wedding here and it was a nightmare!! Everyone was great to meet, and very kind. Being knowledgeable in events I asked important questions about dance floor, linens, outside vendors, time, etc. it all seemed great so I booked my event and paid the deposit. Seeing as I booked it almost a year ahead there was no need to keep in contact frequently. I set out to plan other aspects. When I had a few things planned and wanted to confirm with the venue I emailed the wedding coordinator. She responded and we had back and forth. All good. A month or so later I checked in with her about a previous thing and she changed numerous things they had told me were ok. We referenced the contract which could be left up to interpretation for decision making purposes. I also presented previous emails where I was told these things were ok and they basically said oops, too bad. I didn't hear back from phone calls or emails for awhile and when I did I was told the event coordinator had left and when a new one was hired I would be contacted. A month or two later after MY constant calling I was connected to the new event coordinator. I explained the issues and she informed me she had access to all past emails so she would sort through that and contact....I got nothing. Again after calling for a few weeks I get a receptionist who informs me the event coordinator is no longer there. Awesome. I am told I can speak to the director when she returns...in a month...and she would assist with the wedding. When I call her a week after i knew she returned, it was THE rudest experience I have ever had in a hospitality related facility! I present the facts of all my issues and attempts to contact someone to no end. Her response? ""I doubt that."" I tell her id be happy to send my unresponded emails. She then goes onto have the audacity to explain to me about how I need to not worry about these things and the contract is what it is. She continues onto berate me about the pricing of other venues and how good there's is. Yeah not really! She was frankly the rudest person I ever spoke to. I figured out why they couldn't keep an event planner, they had to work with that woman, Effie. In the end I cancelled my wedding and lost the deposit. A few thousand dollars was NOT worth dealing with them a second longer!! Oh and I had 4 more months till my wedding. They were so kind to keep the deposit and offer no help or ever try to remedy the situation. My wedding was perfect in every way, no thanks to this place.",Couples,,"Texas, United States",Dance,Cypress,NA,No,10/12,A wedding to never have

I've seen folks mention the line (everyone waits in the same line, and at least when we were there, just one person takes orders) and the prices (they wouldn't sound high if the quality was a bit better). Presentation isn't enough to compensate for food that's poorly prepared. They don't really have waiters - and you certainly won't recognize the staff. Maybe they were just incredibly short-handed, or everyone was in training? According to their website ""Paolo Fronza, from Fellini Caffè, runs this sophisticated dining operation."" This doesn't seem like a chef-run operation, and I wouldn't describe it a sophisticated.",Couples,,Texas,Dance,Houston,F,No,09/10,Cafe Express did it better.

The service is okay, but only just. The food, however, is truly something else. I always say that you have to look hard to find a bad meal in Houston. Look no further than MFA cafe - the food is terrible and overpriced. I ordered the ""MFA Salad"", which was advertised as being comprised of arugula, spiced pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and crispy prosciutto in a honey lime vinaigrette topped with fresh herbs. There was arugula, but there was tons of other types of lettuce mixed in as well. Why not just say ""spring mix"" if that's what you intend to serve? There were pecans - fine. There was blue cheese - fine. They also included apples that had clearly been chopped into pieces days before - they were brown as dirt. As for the ""crispy prosciutto""? Hardly - I counted four - literally four - TINY pieces that, combined, were no larger than my thumbnail. This is a meal-sized salad and they literally included well less than one square inch worth of prosciutto. It was served with a piece of ciabatta that was so stale as to be completely inedible. I grant that the prior tenant of the MFA Cafe's space (Cafe Express) may not have been an exercise in fine dining, but it was reliable and offered good-quality, reasonably-priced food.

We first tried to find street parking on the surrounding streets (most are free on the streets, but some are metered). However, with all the construction in the area, there were no open spaces immediately around the center, so we parked in the paid parking lot across the street (ended up costing $5 for our visit). As you approach the entrance, look up to the right and notice the water spray from the fountains on the roof of that part of the building. It is interesting that you cannot see the spray when you are upstairs looking out the 2nd floor windows into the fountain area. You enter the building facing a long wall and to the right (down a hallway) is the entrance to the cafe. We went around the wall to the left instead and this brings you through the main exhibit area with some art features with the security desk at the far end as you round the wall. You sign in at the desk where you would normally pay admission for the special exhibit. The restrooms are to the left of the security desk (with the cafe to the right of the desk). We then went upstairs and entered the special exhibit area which has 4 rooms containing pieces of art. One of the special exhibits was the ""We Chat: A Dialogue In Contemporary Chinese Art"" which ran through July 3rd. It consists of the works of 10 artists showing the change in how new young Chinese artists see their culture.

The exhibits are of course smaller than anything these other big museums would bring, but they are mostly free or have some days when they are accessible to everyone. The potential of this space is huge and I am always somewhat saddened to not see more people here so I am keeping fingers crossed they extend their offering to appeal to more people, to include perhaps classes or workshops (Asian arts, for example, such as origami, or maybe some cooking classes, tai chi, classes on cultural aspects of China, India, Japan, Korea, etc...).
