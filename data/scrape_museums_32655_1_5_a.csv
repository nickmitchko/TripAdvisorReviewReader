I paid $16 to walk around the museum and see the presentation. While the displays are fairly well done and kind of interesting, I found the 3D movie rather boring.

Rather I'm the one anxiously anticipating the overdue opening of the Academy Museum in 2018 to celebrate the motion picture industry. But Jamie's passion is music, so we were there right at 10:30AM when they open and paid our $12.95 tickets to enter. Overall the museum could be more than it is, but what they have is satisfying for music lovers. We were guided to the fourth floor where we were surrounded by perpetual clips of the Grammy Awards ceremonies through the years capped by the Grammy Award itself as it evolved over the years. This was followed by an expansive area featuring sensitive touch-screens in which we could view photos and listen to music of all genres including the true trendsetters from Elvis to 50 Cent. My partner really liked the sound-proof recording booths where various performers and producers provide guidance on the different stages of producing commercial soundtracks. The third floor was my favorite because it featured the famous outfits worn by Grammy Award-winning musicians like Michael Jackson in his iconic videos from ""Thriller"". There were all sorts of interactive stations where you could play instruments like electronic conga drums to follow your own beat. The second floor primarily featured a temporary exhibit celebrating The Ramones, as well as an intimate 200-seat auditorium for special live performances.

In particular, I love how it focuses on the evolution of music over the past 100 years. Keep in mind, if you decide to visit this place, please give yourself at least a minimum of 3 hours to fully enjoy and take advantage of all the interactive musical activities and sound rooms. My favorite section is the one which allows you to listen to how certain genres of music have evolved over the years such as Rap, Country, R&B, and Rock and Roll. The display allows you to listen to music from the origin to the present. The Grammy Museum is also known to feature certain artists during certain times of the year. For example, they featured Whitney Houston following her passing. This demonstration included all of the beautiful gowns Whitney Houston wore during her Grammy performances. They also featured a display of Frank Sinatra's memorabilia. In fact, they even had a dance area for visitors to dance to his music which was packed the last time I visited. My favorite display was the one featuring The Beach Boys. I fell in love with this one because they had a letter written Brian Wilson when he was a Senior in high school. He wrote how he wanted to be a great singer and a loyal husband one day. So awesome! I have to admit that I go to The Grammy Museum at least twice a year and always discover something new each and every time. If you visit this attraction, please remember to show your AAA card for a discount on your ticket. Also, make sure you visit the souvenir shop which includes some unique items you normally wouldn't find anywhere else. In fact, this is where I buy souvenirs for my friends.

Or you can try mixing, or singing along in a sound booth. There's also a section for viewing the Grammy institution's previous educational programs - in their entirety. I watched Marty Balin and the Beach Boys being interviewed and performing. Took up almost half of my 4 hours. I recommend coming alone so you can pay attention to things you like and spend time.

On the first floor, dedicated to Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe..and you can see what they had on their dressers. I saw a lot of pictures of the Golden Age like Mickey Rooney, Frank Sinatra, John Barrymore..so many that come to my mind from the actors my Mother told me about! Many old movie posters from different movies..like westerns, adventure and more..Alot of costumes..and equipment..All of these Golden Age actors were tiny like my petite mother..!\..The original Super Man costume is on display in a glass case in the front!..I saw Superman every weekday in the afternoon after school when growing up..I learned English this way! The car that Cary Grant owned is on display..It was used in a movie with Grace Kelly... From there proceeded to the basement, where I spent most of my time..it was dark to put you in the mood. Greeted by none other than the talking skeleton from Tales from the Grave"" at the door. IT was also dark and those that are easily spooked might get a little nervous or even leave, but hang in there..I took my floor tour clockwise, saw the cell where Hannibal Lector spent his days on Silence of the Lambs..and there was even a padded room but I dared not close the door. From the dark hallway, I saw Jason and Freddy Krueger, not in flesh, but even the mannequins looked lifelike/ Also props and the chainsaw from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre..Elvira was also there..as well as the Mummy..so many horror mannequins in costume, some posters, and more..Hard to take pictures because the museum did not want me to use the flash..After I felt comfortable that I had seen enough...I went to the second floor. The second floor had a regular prop of the Beverly Hillbillies. This floor was mainly dedicated to Awards and ceremonies. There were pictures, costumes, videos, and more. A corner of this floor had Peanuts paraphernalia including the dog..Also many expensive dresses and tuxedos along with pictures of the actors that received their awards. The dresses that the actresses wore on Dynasty are on display!..I saw a prop of the Eiffel Tower in the elevator..there was a worker monitoring it.. THe 3rd floor exhibition dealt with the acccomplishments of gay/bisexual actors/actresses. I already knew that this kind of lifestyle was NOT acceptable in my childhood yrs of the 60s, 70s and prior to this time..If an actor or anyone working in the film industry let the public know they were gay, they were blackballed by the industry. My mother told me that she knew Rock Hudson was gay in the 60s!..so most of these actors lived a hushed up life...only their close friends or companions knew their orientation..Some of these Golden Age actors were Charles Laughton and his wife, Sal Mineo, Betty Davis, Liberace, and more..I saw a lot of their movies and I can attest to the fact that they were really actors..not like today where all you have to be is a pretty face..there is so much trash on the screen and on television nowadays that I do not even go to the movies anymore.. In general, this is a really good museum and worth visiting..but I notice that not all actors or actresses were given their due here. Notably missing was my favorite cowboy, John Wayne..I know that they can not fit everyone in here, but he should hae at least been in a video..maybe he was and I did not notice him..but he was in a Golden Age poster by the door...I could have stayed longer but they were closing..I will post pictures in a later date..!",Solo,13,Texas,Dance,El Paso,F,No,10/07,For Golden Hollywood era lovers like me..this

So when we stumbled across it during our Hollywood Walk of Fame, I insisted that we go. My husband opted out and waited in the lobby. At first it really was interesting. But shadow box after shadow box of people explaining away their relationship detritus started to get tedious quickly. Even though the space wasn't that huge, it felt like it was going to take forever to get through it all to ""get my money's worth."" I will say this: I liked the premise a lot. It reminds me of the book ""Letters of Note"" or ""Lists of Note."" There were gems with insightful, sad, and poignant stories. But that also became problematic in that you generally have to read a whole backstory on what you're looking at unless the objects are already interesting in themselves. However, unlike a book that you can put down and come back to, you don't have this option at the museum. You either force yourself to plow through and read backstory after backstory, or you eventually give up and hope that you're not missing something interesting because your eye got drawn to the object rather than the story. Plus, all backstories are not created equal. Both in the sense of not always being that interesting and in the sense that the authors weren't always that articulate. I definitely admire the curators attempts, but perhaps it would be more suitable as a show within another museum. Or I wouldn't have felt so disappointed if it had been part of a ""shared ticket"" with another small museum.

The overall floor area is quite small, with the number of exhibits ranging from four to six. Admission is free. Exhibition durations range from a few months to ‚Äúongoing‚Äù or ‚Äúpermanent.‚Äù The original name of the Fowler included the wording ‚ÄúCultural History,‚Äù and even though the name has been shortened, expect to experience culturally-related artworks which date from the latter-20th century to very recent (one exception, read below). It is very easy to walk the entire museum in an hour or less. Many exhibits are political or environmental in nature; whatever ‚Ä¶ just something I noticed after many visits. The museum layout is a square. After you enter, pick a direction and keep following it and you‚Äôll end up back where you started. Gallery openings are on each of the four walls; there‚Äôs a [lovely] courtyard in the middle. There‚Äôs a pretty cool museum shop to the right just after passing the front desk. The permanent exhibit called ‚ÄúReflecting Culture‚Äù has a couple hundred pieces of very old (16th thru 19th centuries) European silver. The quality of the collection is amazing ‚Ä¶ if you like silver. If not, walk through quickly or skip it altogether. I like the etched plates and the big sailing ship. The ongoing exhibit called ‚ÄúIntersections‚Äù features works from UCLA‚Äôs permanent collection, and highlights aspects of cultural art from five continents. I have seen this a dozen times and never get bored. Artworks include African and Oceanic masks and reliquary figures, a Mexican ‚ÄúArbol de la muerte,"" a golden statue of Buddha and various baskets and jewelry from different cultures. Check on-line for changing exhibits, which are featured in the other two rooms and also on the walls between galleries (seriously, the walls frequently feature exhibits of photographic or other flat artwork!). At the time of this writing, ‚ÄúMaking Strange‚Äù is very trippy, but fun, and ‚ÄúThe Art of Hair in Africa‚Äù is small, but interesting. SO YOU DON‚ÄôT GET LOST: Enter Parking Structure #4 from Sunset Boulevard. Go downhill into the structure, pass the kiosk on the left (whether there is someone there or not) and turn LEFT. Continue driving as far as you can get to the far wall. Park, and note your stall number. Get a paid parking ticket from one of the machines in either corner and place the ticket on your dashboard. $3 for one hour; $6 for two hours; $12 for all day. Provided you turned left after the kiosk, the nearest stairs/elevator will get you as close as possible to the Fowler from any parking structure. When you get to campus level walk in the direction that puts the large grass field (Wilson Plaza) on your left and a long staircase to upper campus on your right (you‚Äôll be heading due north). The Fowler is 250 feet away, and there are giant banners on the building. Some of the other reviewers have missed these (see my photos), but the museum should not be hard to find provided you come from Structure #4. Hungry? Ackerman Union is where the most food can be found on campus. From the Fowler, head southbound on the same walkway, in exactly the opposite direction you took from the parking structure. Keep going and you‚Äôll encounter an intersection of several walkways that start to go slightly downhill. The big building on the left, with two flights of wide staircases, is Ackerman Union. Go up the staircases and you‚Äôll find a decent food court after entering on the second floor: Panda Express, Sbarro, Wolfgang Puck, Mexican food, etc.",Solo,999,California,Dance,Tustin,M,No,10/12,Excellent cultural art museum; helpful tips below (you won√¢¬Ä¬ôt get lost)

The exhibitions usually revolve around religion or tribal life, and are sometimes grouped into themes that encompass a variety of art from different time periods and countries. Occasionally one specific artist with an amazing creativity niche is featured (e.g., Nick Cave's SoundSuits). No matter what, the exhibits are insightful and educational, and sometimes downright fun. I would recommend a visit to anyone. The Fowler is very strong in tribal art, especially Africa, Pacific regions and the Americas. The collection of African tribal art is superb, and UCLA's African Studies Center publishes the definitive art journal on this subject. The building layout is simple: set around a square courtyard. Just begin with one hallway and check out an exhibit. When you return back to the hallway, just turn the corner and go down the next hallway. You should be able to make a complete ""lap"" in a little over an hour. I go on weekends and try to arrive when the museum opens‚Äînoon‚Äîand I never run into crowds. On occasion there will be a musical performance outside next to the building. If you become a member you get a discount in the museum shop plus invitations to exhibit openings and other events. Notes for your visit . . . (1) Admission is free (2) The most convenient parking is the Pay-By-Space area of Structure 4, via the Sunset Boulevard intersection at Westwood Plaza. $6 for two hours (all day is $12). Take the stairs up to Wilson Plaza and you should be able to see the Fowler sign. Once you‚Äôre out in the open, there‚Äôs no need to take stairs to higher levels of the campus unless you‚Äôre into exploring (some parts are very picturesque). (3) For a quick bite, go to nearby Ackerman Union and take the stairs up to the Terrace Food Court, which has eateries such as Panda Express, Sbarro, Rubio‚Äôs, etc.",Solo,999,California,Dance,Tustin,M,No,10/12,Culture = art; art = culture.

Parked in the outside lot are three vehicles from this incident with bullet holes. As the building was once a working police station, visitors can explore the front desk, and jail cells which once held suspects. Other exhibits show the evolution of handcuff technology, uniforms worn over the years by the department, badges, the role of reserve officers. The museum appears to be a work in progress (rooms closed with other items in storage) with possible additional exhibits forthcoming so it will be interesting to see what is added in the future. I admire the effort, apparently by volunteers, that has gone into this museum, as the LAPD is one of the largest police forces with a long history which needs to be shared. Couple that with the department frequently being featured in the TV and movie industry and this attraction needs to be on your must see list. I would estimate that 3 hours would be ample time to see most everything (but I am the type of person who likes to see and read each exhibit). Make sure not to miss Jack Webb's checked sport coat from the Dragnet TV series hanging framed on a wall on the first floor.
