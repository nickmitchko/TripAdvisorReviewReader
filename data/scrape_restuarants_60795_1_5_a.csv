No surprise, my experience there had been decidedly unsatisfactory ever since they changed ownership several months ago. A local resident who witnessed my confusion stopped to assist me. After a brief discussion he pointed down the block to another establishment, Wong Wong, he suggested I should try. I figured, why not, he lives here so he should know the good spots. Wrong! Wong Wong must be his brother's place because my experience there was worse than my first choice. I had to wait five minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. Finally someone looked at me and pointed to one of the empty tables where I was to sit. After that table was cleaned I did sit and perused the extensive menu. Actually there were two of them, the regular one and another for the lunch specials. I decided on #5 from the regular menu, noodle soup with soy chicken. Big mistake. While the broth had decent flavor and there was an abundance of okay noodles, the chicken was more bone than meat. I had to actually search through the soup to find something to chew on. I was hungry so I did finish the soup, but it didn't get any better. When the bill (written in Chinese) came it was higher than I expected so I questioned my server about it. She took it away somewhere and came back and explained, ""she made mistake"" and provided a corrected check. I felt it still was too high but I was in no mood to quible, so I paid the check with an adequate tip and left the premises.

Two were very small and two were decent size. I asked for tabasco sauce but was brought something similar to a cocktail sauce, which was disappointing. The quality was decent but not spectacular and they garnished the oysters with green leaves that were turning a bit brown. For the main course, I had a beef tenderloin coupled with a lobster tail. Beef was prepared as I had asked and was delicious. The lobster tail was large and of very good quality. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and a bland vegetable. Overall, the food was very good.

I always ask myself “what are they hiding?” However I could not see any problem here. The décor was very Latin with projected images of old photos on the wall giving the impression of being in good company in a Cuban village. The tables were low, so armchairs and banquettes. I fell into an armchair and wondered if these old bones could ever get out again without help. The menu looked very exciting, except with the low lighting I had trouble reading it. I chose the ceviche tasting menu, which came as 3 – 7 courses so you could have it as a starter of just 3 choices or the lot as a main. I had it as a main. The wine list was small but a good variety of local and imported wines. The food was served promptly on a large platter with each dish over ice on a small plate. I do like ceviche with the lime/lemon juice and vinegar cured seafood. It allows the full flavor of the seafood to come through. Each plate had a featured piece. I have listed them in order on the menu but I tasted them randomly so that each was a surprise in flavour. The seven plates were: sea scallops in lime with fennel and a slight spice of chili; lobster, shrimp & calamari in Thai sweet basil and lime juice with cucumber; salmon, tuna and fluke (a flat fish akin to flounder) with chili, sweet potato and lime juice; shrimp with roasted tomatoes in orange juice with crunchy corn nuts and topped with avocado; fluke alone this time in soy, ginger and sesame on rice; a medley of yellowtail, clam and octopus with chive and quinoa; and lastly flounder with habanero chili in cumquat and sweet potato. All very tender and the extras allowing the flavours of the seafood pieces to come through. It is really all done with style and an emphasis on flavour. I did indulge in dessert with a chocolate cigar – their signature dessert. It was dark chocolate coating a log of almond cake with a caramelised milky (dulce de leche) ice cream, which was nicely presented and very rich and indulgent. The bill arrived and then I understood why the restaurant was so dark. There was an extra charge for the lobster dish and although it was present in small print on the menu, it was illegible in the dark. The waitress did not draw my attention to it. Why the extra charge? I don’t know. Since it is one of the choices it should have been included in the cost. Never mind, I just deducted the extra from the tip. Would I come back? Definitely but next time I’ll bring a torch.",Solo,,NA,Dance,,NA,No,01/09,Ceviche Rules OK!

I couldn't suggest otherwise because I have not had the opportunity to try out very many Venezuelan restaurants in my life and so I don't know how this place might compare with other places. But if you are like myself and just want to explore a different restaurant over the weekend without being set on trying out Venezuelan cuisine, then there is absolutely no reason to come to Sazon. Let me tell out some of the things which I did not like about the restaurant: 1. Parking in the vicinity of this restaurant is very hard to find. The Saturday evening we went in, I believe there was a concert going on in the area and we had to look for parking for at least 20 minutes before we could find something. Unlike some other restaurants, there is no parking reserved for patrons of the restaurant close by. 2. This is a cash-only place. I guess I am willing to put up with cash-only policies at food trucks and (maybe) quaint joints in New England serving amazing lob-stah rolls and clam chowder but not at other joints. Come to think of it, even cabs today take credit cards, so why shouldn't a plain-old restaurant in Philly take cards? Especially when they are NOT dirt cheap. Can't think of a good reason. 3. Ultimately, the most important consideration for me in deciding on how to rate a restaurant is taste and between the two dishes my wife and I ordered, the chicken empanada was good whereas the other was definitely bad. Their whole sauteed red snapper was among the LEAST flavorful items I have tasted in a long, long while. Although we had heard good things about the red snapper from a friend of ours and was the sole reason we tried out this place, the dish disappointed us greatly. 4. We had ordered the Morena Truffle and the chocolatier who was supposed to get it out to us after dinner forgot to do so. When we told our server about it, she was gracious enough to acknowledge the mistake and offer two truffles. So far, so good. The issue though is that we didn't have the truffle on that day itself but in another 2 days' time and when we had it, they tasted rancid. If these truffles were to be stored in the fridge, then our server ought to have mentioned that to us. Or even better, the chocolatier should have brought it out after our meals so that we could have enjoyed it right then and there. My comments above should not give the impression that everything sucks about the place. They were open until 11 and the kitchen was open until about 10:45 or so, even though we were the only customers still having food that late. They are a BYOB restaurant and our server happily opened the bottles of beer that we had brought with us. Overall we found the service to be reasonable even though it was late in the day. With all that said, there is absolutely no reason for us to ever return to this place again in the future.

Fantastic and simple farm to table menu and competent but uneven pacing of the service. The room in the lobby of the architecturally fascinating Cira Center is dominated by fine light woods and gigantic picture windows. The location, connected by an enclosed bridge to 30th Street station makes it a great spot for long distance travelers to nestle for a while and is also convenient to locals or Philly suburbanites. With a diner discount, you can partk for $12 on-site at the Cira Center, which makes it easy to drive in and out without having to walk around University City or Center City. At night, the view from the windows out onto the station area is a bit magical. With light hitting the window it is wonderfully challenging to figure out what is actually outside and what is a reflection from inside the restaurant or from the Cira lobby. To the splendid food: We strarted with a small bowl of the Hickory Smoked Georgia Pecans with maple and bacon...a little soggier than they should have been...but they grow on you. The Fall Bean soup was fantastic...plenty of good vegetables (so the fresh beans did not make the soup too heavy) in a ham hock broth with Chorizo and delicate Yukon Gold potatoes. The Brussel Sprouts were also unique and if you think you don't like Brussel Sprouts think again...these babies are prepared with Prosciutto, Allagash honey and roasted orange chestnut. The fresh Glazed Carrots featured toasted cumin, pine nuts, pickled raisins, ginger and celantro...over the top? Sounds like it could be, but it actually came together beautifully. The pork chop (hickory smoked) is sliced into delicate savory strips with one thin side of bone thrown in for those who want something to gnaw on plus 3 dipping sauces.The Russet Potatoes were about as good as it gets...rosemary, thyme, pecorino cheese on a bed of horseradish cream. We split the desert...a brilliant fresh baked item called ""Bourbon"" (Hot beignets with a cream sauce and a Makers Mark dipping syrup.) The food is sometimes advertised as Tapas style, but the dishes are slightly larger than that and ample enough for a couple to share. And Now to the odd pacing of the service. The waiter was very competent and knowlegable but even though it was not crowded it took forever for our drinks to arrive. The Pecans should have come with the soup but the soup lagged way behind. Finally, as the main courses and dessert were presented, the service and pace got rolling well. It was like they suddenly threw the competency switch.

I've found that these events can be disappointing because the limited price point compels the owner to offer lesser platters. Not so, here. The three courses actually duplicated offerings on the regular menu and were prepared in a manner consistent with what you would expect on any other day. The burata, tomato and roasted pepper appetizer was one of the more attractive presentations of this that I have come across, with a pesto that was well done. The pork milanese was a bit underseasoned , but the arugula, apple and Parmesan salad that accompanied it was perfect. The short rib was also good , but the highlight of this dish was the parsnip purée. The wild boar ragu with chestnut fettuccine was as good as I have ever had, including in Italy. So with such good food, why not 5 stars, you ask? Service could have been better. While the owner is wonderfully engaging, the waiter was far too hurried, not spending sufficient time describing special offerings or checking on empty coffee cups. Also, his description of one of the wines was , well, dead wrong. Also, this is a storefront and on the cold night we were there, there was a draft from the front as well as from a rear stairway. The gas hot air heat did not compensate. These are little problems, easily remedied and will not keep us from returning.",Couples,1,Pennsylvania,Dance,Ambler,NA,No,03/14,Friendly

We decided to try the bar, perhaps we could sit there. The bartender was nice and apologized profusely regarding the hostess station, he quickly got a us a table. Walking in the place is nice and we were seated in the back. We were told how the system basically works. You have a coaster that has a green side and a red side. You can turn it to the red side when you don't want meat service and back and forth. We were told we can go to the salad bar, which had a huge arrangement of sides, plus we were given sides at the table. Then the fun inundated us, literally.
