From here things got strange! While the salad and wine came in a timely manner, our main courses did not. While we were in no rush and really enjoyed sitting on the patio and drinking wine, after a while it was very awkward. Tables seated after us were being served, and one even had finished and left before we got our food. There were no big parties, and we got there early so it was very strange. When our food did finally come out they served it to the wrong table who rejected it and had it sent back. 2 min later they served it to us. The food was served hot, very delicious and nicely presented. But then our table became ""invisible"" again as we could not get a cup of coffee, or anything for that matter, for at least 20 min after finishing our meal. We finally got out waiter's attention, had coffee and dessert, paid the bill and left. Long and short, I am giving it 4 stars because the food was so good (reason you go out to eat) and the feel and atmosphere was very small/neighborhood, like your a local.

The neighborhood is good, so there's no worries about walking. Ambiance: Beautiful wood floors, dark tables, very romantic. A little too dark to read the menus, but I'm getting older so there's that. Outdoor seating if you wish. They have a nice bar you can sit at and eat if you wish, but don't serve cocktails. Service: Mixed Results. On the plus side, our waiter steered us toward perfect wine pairings with our ceviche appetizer and hangar steak main course. However, we had a major hiccup in that our main dish came while we were still finishing our appetizer. On the tiny table it was very awkward space-wise, not to mention not yet being ready for the main course. Food: Amazing. The Corvina Ceviche was perfect. The fish was light and tender and not over powered by the leche de tigre, with thinly sliced onion, and crunchy corn. The tartness was well balanced and went well with the sauvignon blanc wine. If you love beef, be sure to get some here. The hangar steak was perfectly medium rare to order with a beautiful char on the outside, served with 3 sauces: garlic confit, chimichurri and a pickled pepper / onion. We also ordered the green pepper corn cream sauce for an additional $3 - well worth it. I could have eaten that alone as a soup (just kidding - but it was delicious and paired perfectly with the meat). We had a side of creamed spinach, which was a cheesy cream sauce disguised as a vegetable. That is not a complaint! Dessert was fine - I had the crepes but wouldn't order them again. Nothing wrong with them, just overly sweet. My husband had the bread pudding and couldn't stop raving about it. Overall, an excellent experience.

Waiting Area: We made our reservation for 7:15 and were seated within a 15 minute period as it was very crowded. The waiting area is right next to the entrance and their is only a small couch for about 5 people to sit so we were forced to stand. This was very awkward as the restaurant is actually very small and many waiters had to come thru the standing area to serve guest in the other room right across from the entrance. Service: Once we were seated, I had the unfortunate placement of being seated in the aisle where waiters were constantly walking behind me and often bumping into me. The server we had was great and her cheery personality made all the previous issues we experienced fade away. She was very attentive throughout our entire meal and bubbly personality made for an enjoyable time. Food: The food was surprisingly very good. I expected the meals to be decent and more so focused on presentation but this was not the case. The portions were reasonable and were very filling. I had the Lobster mac and cheese which came in a nice little mouse trap with real cheese attached to the end and my wife had the Salmon. We were both really satisfied with our meals. Presentation/Recommendation: The presentation of all the food items, as expected, was excellent. The restaurant truly is creative with their presentation and makes for a fun experience, especially if you have multiple people within your party. I would definitely recommend all to try out this restaurant without hesitation.

Unfortunately, we were disappointed in more ways than one. I'd like to start with the positives of our experience. We started our evening by having drinks in the bar. The bartender was attentive and the drinks were fantastic! Loved Roy's Mai Tai and our friends enjoyed the Mango Mojito. Jeannie L , our server for the evening, was delightful. Unfortunately, the rest of our experience that evening was less than satisfying. It's to be expected that dining at a popular restaurant on a Saturday evening will have some glitches, but boy they must have all been at our table! Once we were seated and drink order taken, the bussers for our table were very inconsiderate -- especially how they placed items on the table. Not only did they throw their arms in front of our faces while we were in the middle of a conversation to place items on the table, but they were like bulls in a China shop when refilling glasses with water, taking plates away, etc. It was if they were in such a hurry to get it done, they did not care how it affected our dining experience. Additionally, they removed or attempted to remove plates of our guests before they were finished with their meal. Maybe that's one of my pet peeves, but when a guest is trying to enjoy their meal, even if someone at the table may have finished eating, don't make the other guest still eating feel like that have to rush to finish because the bussers want to clear the table. I'm not there to win a race, I'm there to enjoy my food and evening with friends. At least ask the person if they are done without touching the person's plate. The guest shouldn't have to tell them to stop, they are not done with their meal. At a high-end restaurant like Roy's, one would think management would want their customers to enjoy their experience in a relaxed setting, not made to feel rushed and having to dodge arms of their bussers for fear of being elbowed by those bussers. Now on to the food. Many of the dishes we ordered were as expected. The appetizers were very good, especially the canoe boat and the tuna. Unfortunately, same cannot be said for the main courses. Roy's is known for their fish, but the fish we had was disappointing. The portions of fish were small (the Mahi Mahi was maybe 4 ounces) and just average in preparation and taste, and the butterfish was mushy in texture. Not a dish I would recommend on the menu. Unfortunately, because of our experience at Roy's in Woodland Hills, we will not be returning. .",Couples,,CA,Dance,Westlake Village,NA,No,12/08,Disappointed and Glitches Galore -- In More Ways Than One

The wedge salad was very large and the ingredients were fresh. For our entrees, we finally decided on the petite cut New York strip steak and lamb chops. Both were prepared exactly as ordered and were flavorful. Since the entrees are ordered a la carte, we also ordered sides of Brussel sprouts and asparagus.

The food is just as good as the cheesecakes and they have anything you could think of on the menus and the Cheesecake is just pure heaven!! I am still waiting for them to bring a Cheesecake Factory over to the UK to cure my cravings. I had the tacos for lunch one day which were so fresh and then I had the chicken sandwich for dinner another time which the portion size was incredible! The cheesecakes I've had the Oreo, reeses peanut butter, white chocolate caramel macadamia nut and more but they were my top three of the holiday. The mozzarella sticks and buffalo chicken wings are also a great combination for a starter but are also portion heavy so beware of food overload!",Couples,431,United Kingdom,Dance,Kent,NA,Yes,04/16,Please bring to London!!
