We waited in that one and did not get in until quarter after 8. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. Open bar 4 hours- well less then that since we got in AFTER 8. That was a joke anyway it was cheap liquor and they didn't even carry or make half decent drinks. Bartender continued ignoring us at the bar. It was said floors 2 and 3 for general admission.

When my husband asked if he could go outside and smoke they said ask security and security said not right now. The buffet was the only thing that surprised me to be half decent.

It was an extremely hot and humid day. Arrived after 6 pm and told they would not open til 7pm. We went across the street to a sports bar restaurant to have a snack and water to stay cool. At 7pm we ventured back and a line had formed outside and were still not letting anyone in. I stood in front of a pizza shop which had its oven exhaust blowing on me on top of the extreme heat outside. I started to not feel well due to the heat. Finally at 7:25 they started letting the line in. By the time I managed the second set of stairs I collapsed from the heat. If it were not for my husband to go in search of water to help revive me I do not know what would have happened. The security thugs in the place were pushing me down the steps and wanted me to go outside back into the heat which caused the problem, as opposed to letting me sit in a chair at the top of the landing and recover. A scene ensued to remove me to the outside to walk around and come back. We went back to sports bar and an angel of a hostess saw that I looked piqued and offered to give me a huge cup of ice water which made me feel so much better. I really wanted to go ballroom dancing and we came a long way. We returned and found that we could not attend the event by the security thugs. We were told to leave.

We were made to stand out side the club for at least 45 minutes being constantly told to move into other queues which then meant every time we had to go to the back anf start again!

We were taken up the first flight of stairs which was very dark and seedy looking and told to wait there for a waitress to come and get us. So this went on and on and on for about another 45 minutes, we were taken to the next pillar in one of the rooms and told to wait again, it became obvious that we were waiting for nothing as nobody was coming to find us!We had to find somebody who then took us to the ''VIP'' section which was totally rammed full of people, there was no distinction between the main dance floor room and the ''VIP'' area, there were no tables free in the whole room so we were told to stand and wait again!! basically it was a free for all and people who hadn't paid for ''VIP'' tickets were just sitting wherever they liked!They eventually kicked some people off a table and told us that was were we could sit, it was no bigger than a small bedside table and was already covered in booze from the last people that were sat there. We had people standing all around us so there was literally no space to move, then told to pay another $60 dollars before we got any of our ''VIP'' perks, which was supposed to be food and champagne and vodka.

I didnt see anybody else having any food on there tables so i think that was basically a load of rubbish, although after seeing what it looked like in there i dont think we would have eaten anything anyway! It was a total rip off and a bit of a con really. We ended up having to walk all the way to our hotel and missed midnight so it was a huge dissapointment!

We arrived to the line at 9:25pm (for the 10pm show) and were in our seats at 9:50pm (and that even included a restroom break on the way to the seats). Speaking of the restroom, they had a gal directing traffic in the women's restroom. This kept the line moving quickly! I've never seen such an expeditious restroom process like that! As for the show, The Rockettes were truly amazing. How 36 people can dance in unison for 90 minutes like that...I'll never know, but it was truly a feat to watch.

But hey, it's Bob Fosse, and in the absence of Cabaret, I took myself to TKTS and got a ticket. I'm a hardcore Broadway fan but even I'll admit that occasionally, shows can drag. You're in there for two to three hours and sometimes your mind wanders and you start thinking about dinner. Not at Chicago. The action, jokes and songs are non-stop; even when you think a slow ballad is coming, it turns out to have rude lyrics that get the audience giggling. A unique aspect of Chicago on Broadway is the incredibly interactive role of the orchestra. In most shows, this essential yet (literally) overlooked aspect of the production is hidden below the stage- some audience members might even remain unaware that in every show, the music is live. In Chicago, the orchestra sit on tiers at the rear of the stage, fully visible at all times; the conductor even takes part in the narrative as a character in several moments where the ""fourth wall"" is broken. Audiences love this kind of interaction, I find- we love to be part of the show. So, setting Chicago apart from other shows somewhat, the outstanding jazz orchestra make it a real music-lovers' event as well as, essentially, a dramatic and comic play. The show is also great for any enthusiasts of dance, with immaculately choreographed routines ranging from Charleston to burlesque and vaudeville. I was lucky enough to see Rumer Willis in the role of Roxy but the rest of the cast are longstanding and as such have perfected their ensemble roles- 20 or so actors play 40 or so characters. Finally, Chicago's 49th St location can't be beaten: it's one minute from TKTS at Times Square. So if it gets to 7.30pm and you're unsure what to do for a couple of hours, I urge you to go to Chicago, and razzle dazzle 'em.",Solo,0,0,Dance,Durham,NA,No,0,"Fast-paced, feisty fun- and all that jazz."

It would be great if there was a way to wipe the windows on rainy days. The bus is very high-tech & I'm surprised there isn't a high-tech windshield wiper. 2. While I thoroughly enjoyed the jokes & fun of the hosts, it would have been great to learn a little more history of the buildings. 3.

We got ours on our 3rd attempt after the previous 2 times were sold out. It involved waiting in line at 8am, an hour before the box office opened to get a ""pre-ticket"" followed by waiting at another line to get the actual ticket. The whole process took a good 2-3hours. Sorry but this is just frankly not acceptable. I have seen ticketing process done in 3rd world countries done far more efficiently than how the Ride team does it. The ride itself was a total disappointment, a guy and girl who were unfunny, ignorant and offensive with slapstick moments to justify entertainment. I did like the rapper and breakdance guys but the rest were in poor taste and appalling. For the effort it took to get tickets, I will NOT be recommending the RIDE to anybody, even if its free with the NYpass. There are far better things you can do with your time in NYC.

Most stores lie between 7th and 8th Ave, from 34th to 40th streets (okay, the best ones). Do remember to take your fabric requirements with you, or make sure your smart phone is powered up to search and search. Sometimes the shop owners are abrasive, but all are highly helpful.

My favorite section is the silks, which I never seam to escape with less than a hundred bucks in goods. If you are looking for the tourist experience, former cast mates of Project Runway work in the store and Patches is there from time to time. Though, the fabric will always take center stage. Be prepared to get a little overwhelmed. Aside from a plethora of great shops, Ebad's (literally around the corner from Mood--across from a Scottish bar) sells good, functional fabrics at mid range prices. I go to him for wearable muslin fabrics, as whenever I bust out a new blazer, pants, or shirt pattern textiles from him make the first go around.

Then that was very usual to spot the workingmen pulling the racks of clothing on the busy sidewalks in the Garment District or Garment Center or Fashion Center. But all this industry started much earlier, in the beginning of the twentieth century. That were immigrants from Eastern Europe, especially the Jewish people who made the real outbreak with the knitting industry and offered the various production for the wide population, inhabiting New York. Since the arrival of cheaper overseas labor and production, has begun the decline of this industry in Garment District. Now passing along these streets between the Seventh Ave. and Ninth Ave. You can perceive the remaining names of the textile stores on the facade of the high buildings that flank these narrow passages ,otherwise mainly whole such production shifted to other regions of New York, even to other states within USA or to other countries of the world. What we now have as the memories at these glorious times of the fashion in New York are the monument to the Garment worker, one bronze statue by Israeli sculptor and the small cutting and sewing rooms as well as zipper, button and supply stores in the Garment Center.

However, local art enthusiasts should add this little treasure to their schedule. And it will fit easily into that schedule given that the full holdings can be adequately experienced in about an hour and if you cut some of the sillier presentations - such as a collection of 15th century door knockers (not making that up) - you can see the high points in about 40 minutes. The centerpiece consists of a full, very large room, inhabited by a mural painted on canvas covering the full experience of life in Espana. Sorolla's fuzzy brushstrokes leaving something to be desired but the sheer scale impresses. Much of the rest of the paintings worth seeing have a heavy emphasis on Christian iconography and are a must see for fans of religious art. Architecture fanciers should add a visit on their must see list given the grandeur of the buildings and the grounds particularly against the modest backdrop of Spanish Harlem.

Check in went fairly smooth and did not end up mattering much what number/letter you got because other than the ""young"" line going in first, the rest of the process is Pages finding a group of seats which fits your party (someone else mentioned earlier some get letters some get numbers based on age, etc, this appears true based on my same experience). Obviously, the young line gets lower seats but the place isn't big so all seats are pretty good. The front rows do lose some visibility because of the crew/cameras. I will say that the whole end to end process does take from about 3pm-ish to 8ish (for those with guaranteed tickets) with a break in between. I think security checks could move much faster if they added another line rather than just everyone waiting to go through one. Once you got into the elevator to go up to the studio the Pages were great. The one we had at our section was funny and talkative and answered a lot of interesting questions. The ones where you line up before going up are not friendly but it's not that long that you deal with them. I honestly loved the whole thing!

If you go into this expecting long waits, you’ll be less disappointed! On the day of our show taping, the guests were Keri Russell and Ted Cruz. I find that a big part of the fun is the stand-up comic that entertains the crowd before the show, and between recordings. I had an aisle seat in the third row, and the comic made some fun jabs at me throughout the taping (because I wore a bright orange sweater, and because I was from Toronto....thanks, Rob Ford). My view was relatively unobstructed. But it really was easier to watch it on the TV screens (which defeats the purpose of going to a live taping). But also, the interview desk is far back from the audience. I’m not sure how people in the front row see anything with the all the production staff and camera equipment in the way. You get to ask Seth questions between takes as well. I noticed some people put a lot of thought into their questions. My biggest complaint are the false prize promises the pages give you. You are informed that there will be prizes/give-aways for audience members that display the most enthusiasm.

Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation are the authorities for this park with their mission to provide “world class recreational, environmental and cultural destination” to its residents, and they have succeeded in providing a wonderful place to New Yorkers. Since i am more familiar with Pier area and since each Pier area developed has its own uniqueness, beauty and charm, I need to be fare enough to write a few lines,separately on each Pier area and off course, i have written a few lines on other areas too. Pier -1: This area has three large landscaped lawns, playground for children, granite view stand/steps and also has developed and maintained gardens with native plant life and freshwater plants. One can sit in the lawns or on the granite view stand/steps for hours with friends & families or simply sit in front of the water front,viewing the Lower Manhattan skyline and watch a variety of moving boats.

Pier - 3: This area is known for its Greenway granite terrace with granite blocks and the unusually designed,sloping hills running all along the Pier-3 ( As per the records the hills are designed in such a way that it dilutes the intensity of sound (from nearby Brooklyn/ Queens expressway),resulting in reduction in noise pollution. Pier-3 also has two beautifully landscaped lawns and even have library. One can get awesome view of New York Harbour, besides the Governors Island and Statue of Liberty. Pier - 4: This is one place along the piers forming the part of Brooklyn Bridge Park development, where one can get a feel of the beach with sand and can literally reach the edge of the water.

Setting is intimate, a thrust stage and seating capacity of 140 plus 20 standing room. friendly bar prices included wine or beer for $6. DOWNSIDE: Why, why, why were there no people of color and only one woman out of the 8 performers we saw? This doesn't look like a diverse array of talent, and it diminishes the Fey & Poehler association. There are up to 50 bad seats in the house, mostly those closest to the back wall in the 2 side sections. There are 10 or more bad seats in the center section due to a column that obstructs views. We attended the 7:30 and 9:00 PM perfs on Jan. 30 in which both improv teams stayed stage right for a large chunk of time making the closest side section a poor vantage point and probably half of the other side action, too.

The current facility is a disservice to your business, school, performers and AUDIENCE.

There is no amplification in the small theater, and when the performers don't bother projecting their voices it is hard to follow. Even more so when they play to only one side of a three-sided theater. I would have given an even lower rating except that the price is quite low, if you can get in. Maybe other nights were better.

There is a separate gated entrance for bicycles and strollers. A different ferry also comes and goes from Red Hook, Brooklyn.This is a great place to bike as there are no cars on the island. Rangers get around on golf carts. You can rent a bike. There are tandems and pedal wagons for 4-6 people. Once on the island if you do not want to bike or picnic, there are many other things to do. You can explore Castle William, but be prepared to climb stairs. There is also a walking tour from Soisson''s Landing at 2:30. I am told that there a different events on different weekends. I found out all about holograms. There is also a house with photo diaries of Coast Guard families who used to live on the island. The island closed for the winter on September 27, but you still have time. It is well worth it. One word of advice, the only comfort stations I saw were at the Welcome Center at the ferry dock.

But being we had seen a lot our of our numerous NYC trips... we were in for something off the beaten path. The ferry from South Ferry Station takes about 10 minutes to get you across to Governor's Island... at a very cheap $2 return fare (Free on weekends). I was very surprised that no one actually checked if we had purchased our tickets before any of our boardings... The island used to be a former fort and was much smaller. It was extended thanks to having the earth from the subway system being dug out, dumped here. It then was host to military / navy base... which explains all the still standing (and very nice) buildings. Too bad though that more use is not made out of them. Exhibitions, art studios, even condos could be a good used for them. Sad. The walk along the various paths on the island was pleasant and mostly shaded... which comes handy during hot and humid summer days. There are plenty of vendors along the paths to keep you hydrated (there are also free water fountains) and fed. The visit of Castle Williams is free and is taking place every hour at the half-hour. Tickets can be obtained from a Ranger at the Castle. It lasts about 30 mins and is very insightful of what the Castle and island were all about. As an extra perk... you get to go on the roof of the Castle and get spectacular views of Lower Manhattan.

When the street grid was laid out in the early 19th century, all of Manhattan was going to be streets with precious few plots set aside for parks as in cities such as Paris and London and almost any other that you can name. But visionaries fought for a huge swath of what was then way uptown--from 59th St. to 110th St. and what is now Fifth Avenue to Central Park West--to be Central Park. They managed to get it through the state legislature to make it happen. It is a grand public space and we New Yorkers guard it jealously against encroachments even from the Metropolitan Museum of Art which is in the park and always wants more land. While the Central Park Conservancy, a private charity, can be credited with rehabilitating the park, they have also gotten to control more of it than a private group should. Parks should be funded out of city tax levy money and all parks throughout the city should get their fair share of funds--not just those surrounded by wealthy neighborhoods. And the park is almost off-limits now for those of us who need it from time to time to accommodate mass demonstrations as with the great peace and LGBT and anti-nuke marches of the past. All that said, it is a beautiful public space and I urge you to walk through parts of it any time you are near it. Don't take the crosstown bus, WALK through it. You might want to take a horse-drawn carriage (very expensive!) for a really special occasion, but avoid the rip-off artists with the pedi-cabs who have to post their rates but can charge whatever they want--some $3 per minute, others $5 per minute. You want to pay $100 for a 20-minute pedi-cab ride in the park, be my guest. But the real pleasures of the park come from walking through it. A great walk and not all that long is to enter at Columbus Circle and walk northeast up to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You will pass the Sheep's Meadow and then go a little east up the tree-sheltered mall and the Bandshell to the heart of the park just above 72nd St. where the lake and Bethesda Fountain are. There is an expensive Boathouse Cafe there--nice for special occasions or stopping for a drink--but also counter service for drinks and lunch that you can eat outside or indoors behind the swells in the Boathouse Cafe but still with a view of the lake (where you can rent a rowboat). (There are also nice restrooms inside there. The park has more open than ever in memory, which is a blessing.) Swing a little east toward Fifth Avenue and walk past the boat pond where model sailing ships are afloat. There are coffee/snack bars there as well. Keep walking north on the east side of the park and you will hit the Metropolitan around 81st Street. There are many other great walks that you could take--to the zoo on the east side (though it sadly charges admission now), along the lake, around the reservoir (Lake Jacqueline for Jackie Kennedy Onassis), through The Ramble on the West Side (you may get a little lost, but so what?), past the Delacorte Theatre and the Great Lawn, up to the hillier northern part of the park with its own lake and the incomparable Conservatory Garden inside Fifth Avenue at 105th St. It's (almost) all free.

We visit for dimsum, for Vietnamese food (Na Trang), for Malaysian Chinese dishes (New Malaysia), for the steamed and baked pork buns, hopis, for fresh soy milk and soy pudding. Roast duck and roast pork are available by the quarter pound. The Chinese bakeries have fluffy and not very sweet cakes, but I like the egg custard tart best.

The excellent special exhibits often capture that populist vision very well, and the display rooms are organized so that every section is easily understood -- and yet filled with information in case you want to study further. The collection’s holdings range from prints and photographs, decorative arts and costumes, paintings and sculptures, to even toys and theatrical memorabilia. The Museum of the City of New York was also the first in the United States to establish a curatorial department for toys, and features the dollhouse of Carrie Walter Stettheimer (1869-1944) — a 12-room dollhouse showcasing the fashion and style of New York's Gilded Age in miniature form. The dollhouse features miniature paintings of the great paintings of the era -- painted by the artists that created the originals themselves. I particularly enjoyed the current exhibit “Jacob A. Riis: Revealing New York’s Other Half,” which features photographs taken by Riis and totally consistent with Brown's original vision. Chalsty’s Café, located on the second floor, offers a variety of local and seasonal dishes and snacks, including soups, garden salads, and artisanal sandwiches. I find it a very calming place after the excitement of the exhibits, and the food, although limited, isn't bad.

I was really disappointed. My husband came out asking me what tenements and settlements were. While it had a few interesting tidbits about his life, there was almost no context of why his work was important--even a few words about the growth of tenements in NYC in the 19th Century would have given it a much richer context. I also saw the Activist New York and NYC Marathon exhibits and found them similarly lacking. The Activist New York exhibit had about 10-12 panels about different movements, again each given a shallow treatment with a brief timeline, a paragraph about the movement, and some artifacts. It would have been much more satisfying to see fewer movements presented in more depth, or at least some through-line of how the various activist movements built on or related to each other than simply 10 paragraphs about activism. The Marathon exhibit also had a few fun facts, but was mostly photographs which I'm sure had interesting stories behind them, but these were not presented. In the age in which one could easily go to an online archive and find much more about the marathon, including, I'm guessing, similar pictures with captions actually explaining them, a museum should strive for more. I'm also a bit miffed because the website says ""suggested"" admission and other reviewers mention it, but when we went to purchase our tickets, the salesperson just charged us $28 for the two tickets as if it was standard. A bit shady not to mention it's merely ""suggested"" if it truly is.

The old museum itself, on Fulton Street closer to the East River, was ravaged by Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012. The galleries have, as of August 2015, not reopened; there are are about half a dozen artifacts visible in the lobby. The museum sells entry tickets to the old ships located in the East River, a few paces to the east; tickets are also sold at the site. The Peking is a commercial sailing ship, dating from 1911 (the tail end of the sailing-ship era); the Ambrose is a lightship from 1808; both are quite fascinating (if you're ever in Finland, do not miss the museum ship Pommern, in Mariehamn in the Aland lslands, which is identical to the Peking, and built at the same time and place).

I want to see it again when it has a a neat collection of pedestrian malls, shops, cafés and galleries, which offer their visitors a glimpse into New York's maritime past. This district, located on the East River, spans over 10 blocks and includes structures that were once counting houses, warehouses and artisan shops. The South Street Seaport Museum still boasts several original 19th century vessels among its unique collection. And a little history: The first pier in the area got established in 1625, when the Dutch West India Company founded an outpost here. With the influx of the first settlers, the area was quickly developed. One of the first and busiest streets in the area was today's Pearl Street, so named for a variety of coastal pearl shells. Due to its location, Pearl Street quickly gained popularity among traders. The East River was eventually narrowed. By the second half of the 17th century, the pier was extended to Water Street, then to Front Street, and by the beginning of the 19th century, to South Street. In 1728, the Schermerhorn Family established trade with the city of Charleston, South Carolina. Subsequently, rice and indigo came from Charleston. At the time, the port was also the focal point of delivery of goods from England. In 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, the British occupied the port, adversely affecting port trade for eight years. In 1783, many traders returned to England, and most port enterprises collapsed. The port quickly recovered from the post-war crisis. From 1797 until the middle of 19th century, New York had the country's largest system of maritime trade. From 1815 to 1860 the port was called the Port of New York..... read the rest on the net, if you so desire. This place is the place where all had been started in New York ! PS. You know what ?

After the awesome Pennsylvania Station was demolished in the early 1960s, New Yorkers pushed for landmarking and preservation of great buildings large and small. Before Grand Central could be landmarked, the owners wanted to tear it down to put up an office tower. One of the leaders of the fight to save it was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who RARELY got involved in public causes. But the City did landmarked and her support for the landmark law weighed heavily on the US Supreme Court when they ruled that the landmarks law was indeed constitutional. That is a great part of her legacy. This building is not just for commuters. If you are anywhere in the area of E. 42nd St., make this a destination to take in the soaring vaulted main hall and the side halls. It has been mostly restored and stripped of the big billboards that used to dominate the space. The East staircase looks as if it has been there forever but it was installed only within the last 20 years. The ceiling has been restored, but it remains a reverse view of the stars in the night--a big whoops from the original construction in 1913. There are lots of places in the corridors to grab a quick bite or drink and fancier restaurants now around the peripheries of the main hall. There are also some smart shops in the corridors. Up the West staircase and to the left is the entrance to the Campbell Apartment that used to the offices of the executive of the railroad but is now a palatial setting for a relaxing drink and something to nosh on. Downstairs is the famous Oyster Bar--a relatively expensive fish restaurant that also has a lunch bar and a quieter side room. Be sure to look up at the terrific Guastavino ceilings. Also downstairs is a large, diverse food court with plenty of places to sit and eat. Grand Central is also a great sight from outside on 42nd Street, especially when it is lit up at night.

Can't say enough about his knowledge and humor! The few times we got off the bus for a walking tour was great as was the beautiful weather! Lunch at Fulton market was a perfect mid day stop. The Statin Island ferry tour was wonderful..Shelley knew exactly where we should go on the ferry to get the most out of the ride. The highlight of the day was the visit to the 9/11 memorial. We stayed behind to take the museum tour on our own, it was awe inspiring and reflective. A must see while in NYC. Shelley is an asset to this company! The one negative was our driver...after reading other reviews I see that their drivers added to a positive experience.

I've been on the hop-on, hop-off tours before, so this time decided to do a walking tour (The Dozen Apples tour run by @realnewyorktours ) as it promised a different slant on the NYC tourist thing as you were taken round by a local on foot (and tube) and got to see some of the more off the beaten track things. So the group of 12 of us met up outside the Paramount Plaza (north of Times Sq) and our superb guide Trey took us off on our all day tour. First stop was the SoHo area of town and then wandered round to the steadily shrinking Little Italy and the expanding Chinatown. From here we continued south past the Brooklyn Bridge and headed through into the financial district and Wall Street, then to Ground Zero and the Freedom Tower. Lunchtime now, so we headed off to Greenwich Village to grab a bite to eat. We were given loads of recommendations, but going for a slice of pizza at the famous Joe's Pizza (according Zagat and Time out is the best pizza in NYC) and then to Pasticceria Rocco where I got one of their infamous black and white cannoli's. Seriously - go to those 2 places...it's worth making the trip especially.

Our guide was Gregory who seemed to have an encyclopedic knowledge of New York. We started off just north of Times Square and followed the story from there to the Upper West side of Central Park and Strawberry Fields. We had visited Central Park the previous day and although the guided walk covered the same ground, it was amazing how much additional historical information Gregory added about the residents of the 'uptown' buildings, the history of Central Park and the various structures within the park. We then headed down to Greenwich Village for a lovely lunch and more information about the area and its purchase into public ownership. We also visited George Washington park, where they play the outdoors chess. Our only minor criticism was that we wanted to stay here longer to watch them playing. The next part of the tour was another area that we had already visited (Little Italy/chinatown), but again Gregory's knowledge of its history and architecture was an eye opener and added to our enjoyment. We finished up our walk covering the government buildings, oldest churches in New York and Wall Street. Gregory really made this an enjoyable walk even though we covered a lot of ground and it was a very long day. He was very knowledgeable about the local history and architecture and showed us examples throughout the day that tied in with his overall narrative of the growth of New York from a Dutch colony to being the centre of world finance. Gregory also shared personal anecdotes that ranged from the comedic to his very sad personal memories of 9/11. We cannot recommend this tour enough.

We chose the Half Apple Downtown tour, which took in Greenwich Village, Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown, Wall Street and Ground Zero among other sites. It seemed as good as any to immerse ourselves in the ‘real NYC’. On our appointed day we headed for the cigar shop in Greenwich village, wondering how we would know our guide and who he/she would be. No problem, he found us, and what a great guide David Lowitz turned out to be. We were lucky enough to have him to ourselves for the next three hours. He was friendly, affable, knowledgeable, and just fast talking enough to make us believe he was a definite local. However the one incredible skill that David possessed, was the ability to talk to us, while walking backwards and crossing roads against the lights! His comfort level in the environment was a confidence builder and his easy going style was delightful. David started by asking us if we had anything that we particularly wanted to see, and like the worst of all tourists and following much reading, I had a list. Among other things I wanted to see brownstone homes and caste iron buildings, a few mafia sights in little Italy and the odd movie site to top it off. Nothing fazed David! He easily met all my requests and went above and beyond with little snippets of information that we would never have known if it was not for him. Now if you told me, that I was going to walk, for three hours solid through New York from The Village down to Wall Street, I would have said no way! Too long, too hard and my feet would be killing me! However with David, the time just flew and I never felt like dying at all. He had a top sense of humour which was most enjoyable and a sense of occasion, like agreeing to holding the money we had paid him, in front of the New York Stock Exchange, while he and my husband looked like conspirators in a global financial transaction, just so I could take a photo. Following the end of the tour, he asked us what our next moves were and we said we would look for somewhere to each lunch. He immediately recommended Fraunces Tavern, where we had a fantastic lunch, while listening to the Sunday afternoon Jazz Band and immersing ourselves in the New York environment. The perfect lunch following the perfect tour. The only thing, that is left for me to say now is, sorry it took me so long to review David, but all good things take time!

Here are some tips for the best experience--first, if you are able, upgrade to Premier. It's $25 more, but you get the best seats on the ship (on the left side of the ship, so you'll see the Manhattan side the entire time), you get wait service at your seat, the chairs are cushioned, and there are cup holders on your armrests. I didn't get Premier, but I wish I did. Second, if you don't opt for Premier, here's the next best thing. Choose a seat on the upper deck on the left side of the ship, as close to the Premier seating as you can. This is the side of the ship that will be on the Manhattan side the entire time. There is no assigned seating--it's first come, first served, so get to the pier early so you can be one of the first ones to board. If you get up, you may lose your seat unless you're with someone who can save it for you. Right now, there is a coupon code on Circle Line's website for $5 off. So, for $36, this 2 1/2 hour cruise is an amazing bargain. You will see so many points of interest--I think there were about 100! The cruise is narrated by a live person, so you know exactly what to look for. You'll go under a dozen or more bridges.

Come on Circle Line, get the technology in place to scan the bar codes from mobile phone bookings and cut out the queuing for people who have pre-booked. Once we had posed for the obligatory photo (which we bought as they are pretty cool) we sat upstairs in the open air section. Great seats gave us great views throughout the tour.

Located on the heights in Brooklyn where George Washington's army fought the first major battle of the Revolutionary War, the Cemetery is also a member of an early group of burial grounds that became part of the Rural Cemetery movement -- a movement that eventually led to the creation of America's public parks. Green-Wood joined three other similar cemeteries in the movement: Mount Auburn in Cambridge, MA, Laurel Hill in Philadelphia, and Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, VA. A massive, ornate, set of stone gothic arches frames the entry to this beautiful ""garden cemetery."" An excellent example of Rural Cemetery design, the well cared-for grounds are cut through with roads that meander up and down sloping, grassy areas and lead you to some striking vistas of flowering shrubs and flower beds, giant old trees, and spectacular cemetery artwork. On Battle Hill, the site of the Battle of Brooklyn, you come upon the statue of Minerva. Turn around and you're looking at the skyline of Manhattan and you see that Minerva's upraised arm is hailing the Statue of Liberty in the harbor. Give yourself at least a half-day to take in the sites of this gem. You can purchase a map that directs you to the MANY graves of well-known ""residents"" -- from Leonard Bernstein and Jean-Michel Basquiat, to Horace Greeley and Boss Tweed -- you can bring a picnic, or you can come for one of the many tours.

Here are many interesting grave monuments, and many interesting people are buried here.

The main gate to the cemetery, on 5th Avenue at 25th Street, is an elaborate neo-Gothic concoction from 1865; ask the guard for the free guide booklet that is handed out. The cemetery also has several interesting bodies of water, and undulating terrain with high - well, high by Brooklyn standards - hills, including the highest point in Brooklyn. The cemetery also has three other gates. Also check on TripAdvisor the page about the Sunset Park neighborhood; even in this architecturally not-terribly-exciting district, it is always wise to bring a copy of the architectural guidebook AIA Guide to New York City. Shortly to the south of the cemetery, or east of Sunset Park, is the neighborhood of Borough Park (aka Boro Park), which is the main bastion of ""Ultra-Orthodox"" Jews in the United States.

To get here by public transportation, you must take the (free) Staten Island Ferry (which is a very nice experience and a great way to see the Statute of Liberty without paying for a harbor cruise) and then take a city bus. Total travel time will be at least an hour each way, plus the time it takes to get to the ferry terminal in lower Manhattan--and it could be substantially more. We felt that the amount of travel and waiting for the ferry and bus was more than this attraction warranted.

My second issue is the stew, for a time period that people ate with their hands, because vegetarians get the stew you have to eat it with a plastic spoon. Again ruins the experience of the whole Medieval time period. Now to one of my biggest issue with this meal...ITALIAN ICE? What? So the regular meal is pretty authentic multiple courses and ""dishes"", and the vegetarian meal is pretty ridiculous and no courses and pretty much have us eating from a bowl with a plastic spoon the whole show. I will say it's nice that they'res an option. But I'd like to know is the corn made with meat product? Is the potato made with animal skin, or the pastry? It's probably the bread isn't it?

Historic Richmond Town in Staten Island attempts to show the rural history of the island, & does so wonderfully. There are over 2 dozen buildings here, some from as early as the 17th century, brought from various parts of the island; a few are in situ [on the original site]. While you need to purchase a guided tour to see the interiors of the houses, you can see them well, any time of day, from the outside, which doesn't cost a penny. And this is a rare occasion when you could be grudgingly forgiven for leaving the architectural guidebook AIA GUIDE TO NEW YORK CITY in your hotel or home, since the superb signs outside the houses tell you more than the book possibly could. But do pick up a free map & brochure at the ticket office/gift store. The buildings are outrageously picturesque, & include farm houses, artisans' houses, a church, a schoolhouse, a fine old courthouse (in situ), & even 2 old preserved outhouses - seldom seen in this kind of place! Opposite the courthouse, don't miss the in situ building used as a historical museum, with a small but lovingly presented collection of historic Staten Islandiana & bric-a-brac, including a gorgeous collection of children's & babies' items from 1820 to 1910 - little gloves, shoes, socks, bibs, carriages & toys - a must for anyone who has, works with, or simply likes, little children! You can get here by bus, but it's quite simple to take the Staten Island Railway (SIR) from the ferry terminal; the train, which does not connect with the subway, is similar to a subway train, & costs the same, MetroCards accepted; if you return by train, the fare is not collected. Get off at Oakwood, & walk west on Cedarwood Avenue, left (south-west) on Amboy Road, & right on Clarke Avenue.

That is usually what most reviews of this place are for. If you want to go here ""just to see it"" you really, really need to reconsider that. There's nothing here. You will not see people in costumes waiting to tell you about history, like Colonial Williamsburg. If you come here you'd better be very, very interested in old architecture/buildings. I do like stuff like that, I love taking pictures of colonial and Victorian era structures, but this place bored me. We took a tour which was nice, but that's literally all you can do. We took tons of pictures and learned a lot about the old houses and saw some neat things. If you are here on a day that nothing is happening, your ONLY choice is to go on the tour. After the tour is done, you can, hopefully, go into the cafe, which is really quite cute and very relaxing and wonderful. Unfortunately it is volunteer run and according to our tour guide it is usually not open. Let's talk about the cafe for a bit, though. It's nice, and I'm sure that if you go during a special meal like breakfast or dinner it is probably wonderful. We went and they had sandwiches and cake and soda and tea. OK, snack food, that's cool, and fortunately that's what we were in the market for. The ladies were so amazingly sweet and nice to us and we ordered sodas. We drank them and thought they tasted funny. A look at the bottom of the cans we were given showed they were expired by TWO YEARS. So we expected to walk around this nice place after the tour and the cafe but after about 5 minutes we were literally done looking. We extended our stay by quite a while by taking pictures of somewhat interesting buildings, but that was it. There was no context. I dare say it was boring. One second you'd be looking at something from the 18th century then next you'd see something from the 1950s, then next you'd see something from 1904. There's no consistency and everything is run down and abandoned. You absolutely need to come here during a real event or it is not worth it. If you live nearby or if you are a tourist but have a whole lot of time to kill, and I mean you are visiting New York for an entire summer or something, then maybe it's worth coming here. But considering there are so many things in New York that are worth seeing, I would heartily recommend against it. If you are going to visit Staten Island, go to Snug Harbor. It's closer to the ferry and much, much more interesting and nicer and has a lot to offer. Honestly, we had a good time seeing the interiors of the houses so it was a good day trip, but on the scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 4.5. If you want to visit this place, it is free to walk around but if you want to see the interiors of houses you need to purchase a tour for $8. The tour and small museum is worth that much, so no waste there. Free with an IDNYC. Do not come here just to walk around, you'll be done in 10 minutes. It is a fun curiosity at best, a minor diversion. Not worth a long trip unless you know someone on Staten Island and you are visiting them and they will drive you there and you spend an hour on the tour and go on your way. If you are a tourist, don't bother. This is not a mini-colonial Williamsburg. It is just not. If you live in one of the other boroughs and don't have a car, it will take you either a long bus ride or a SIR ride and a mile walk AFTER your long trip on the ferry while dodging the questionable people at South Ferry trying to sell you trips to the Statue.

It was a bit of a pain to get to on public transport but it was worth it. There is so much to see in addition to the pumpkin patch; the maize maze, animals and petting zoo, hayride and the Adriance Farm House, that you can tour. The prices were reasonable, ranging from $3-5 per activity. There are also food stalls so you can get a snack. A lot of places are *cash only* so make sure you have money with you. There were so many pumpkins! Even as an adult I was excited, so kids will love it, as well as all the animals. I would give the hayride a miss, we lined up for quite a while for essentially two loops of the car park. It is a bumpy ride and you don't really see anything. We didn't do the maze, but it looked loads of fun. We toured the farm house, which was around 45 mins, I would say only do this if you have time after everything else, as there are only 3 rooms to see and the commentary can be a bit slow, but 'Mister Marty' is really nice and knowledgeable about the farm. There is also a little farm shop that is worth a look, where you can buy eggs. It is a fun day out for adults and families.

The problem in person is there is soooooooo much pointless waiting before the show. Lining up at 2 to 3 PM - not fun when it is 35 degrees and windy - just to check in and be divided into 3 groups Then a short intro talk at 3 PM with instructions to meet at the 3 Monekys bar around the corner on 45th Street at 3:35 PM. More waiting at the 3 Monkeys, and finally around 4 PM we get directed to follow the intern with red hair, who leads us to stand outside the front door of the theater once again, while group A gets led in to the nice seats on the lower level of the auditorium, and we in groups B and C wait. Finally we go in, and I am sitting in the upper level, with a birds eye view of most of the set and the gazillion lights. We get lots of instructions from one of Dave's sidekicks on how to applaud enthusiastically, but not too much, and no hooting, and finally around 4:40 PM the show actually starts taping. Fortunately they had something interesting and real - a human cannonball from Ringling Brothers that day, and then Ben Stiller pretending to do it (he actually climbed inside the big cannon) - which helped make up for a rather lame Top 10 list. The band was very loud, and plays a lot more of the time than you are aware of when watching the show on TV, but Paul Schaeffer was missing this day. The chance to see a live band was one reason I choose to go see this. The band was good, but the problem is that they are there to fill time during commercials. So they play extended versions of songs - Manic Depression by Jimi Hendrix specifically - until the show is ""back"" from a commercial break, but which commercials are of course not really happening in real time. The guest music group that played at the end was like most groups on late night shows, one you never heard of, and never will again, but had what seemed like a good lead singer, and were not as loud or long as the house band. Dave was his polished self, with a decent monologue, and seemed to react well with Ben Stiller, the one person he interviewed. Before taping Dave took some questions from 2-3 people in the lower section, which brings up the point that the upper section audience is all but ignored by the entire show. One thing I could not help but notice was that in addition to the dozen or more young interns you meet when getting and picking up your tickets and getting prepped, is all the people milling around the set, but who don't seem to do much. You'd think after 20 years they would operate a little leaner than this - I mean to me it seemed like they has so many people around that they would get in the way of each other (.i.e. too many cooks...). The taping was done by 6 PM. So overall, the show that night was not bad (the Top 10 list sucked), but it is not worth waiting 2 hours for - unless you really like Dave Letterman, or have never seen the inside of a TV studio, or at least get a seat reasonably close. So I give it about a B on content, and C- on execution. The show is free, which is a plus compared to most other shows in NY, including the tour of the Saturday Night Live studio a few blocks away at Rockefeller Center. I hope they make the audience experience more user friendly when Stephen Colbert takes over in May.",Solo,0,0,Dance,Forest Hill,NA,No,0,"about what you'd expect, but too much waiting"

Thoroughly enjoyed the experience, band is great as is Dave, great time all around. I'm putting a lengthy, detailed review below but for an overall review, it is great and you should try for tickets before Dave's last show on May 20 of next year. I had tix in advance so I can't comment on the standby ticketing process. Early November I submitted request for Dec 8 or 9 tix thru CBS/Letterman website. On Dec 4 received call from a 212 area code # on my cell. Ignored it since I don't know anyone in NYC. I checked the voicemail and it was from a lady with the show. She said I had requested tix for Dec 8/9 and to call back right away that they don't hold tickets for very long at all. I called her back about 20 minutes after she had called me and she asked me which of the dates I would like, then said I would only get the tix if I answered a trivia question about the show correctly (My question was What color is the announcer's hair? Red. They have a few other questions they ask. I've read that if you get it wrong they tell you to try for standby tickets). I answered correctly and she asked for my name as it appears on my drivers license and same for my guest and contact numbers for both of us. I'm guessing if you're from outside the US you'd give your name as it appears on passport. She told me to show up at the theater on day of taping between 2pm and 3pm. Note- some days they tape 2 shows so be sure to listen to what time they tell you to show up. She said at front of line to say I was on her Gold List. Gold List doesn't mean anything really as far as I could tell, not VIP status or anything like that. The day before the show I found out my guest couldn't go with me so I called the lady back (by the way she was super friendly and helpful at all times) and told her I would be going but my guest wouldn't. I wanted to give back his ticket in advance so some other lucky person could use it. That was no problem, she canceled his ticket, confirmed I was still good to attend solo, and said thanks for calling in advance to cancel the one ticket. Day of taping, I arrived at the sidewalk in front of theater and there were plenty of Letterman pages/staff to direct people. There were probably about 50 guests outside and more in the lobby at this point. I said the list I was on, and they told me where to line up. Be sure to have your ID with you and out at this point. There was torrential rain at this point and they did a good job keeping everyone under the marquee or in the lobby to keep us dry. Was in line about 3 minutes, then a guy asked my name and checked it off on the list and said to head into the line in the lobby. You then get your hand stamped with one of those invisible/ultraviolet stamps or whatever they're called. Waited in line there about 5 or 6 minutes and showed ID again, name checked off a different list and I was given my ticket and told I could put away my ID that it wouldn't be needed again. Waited in another line for about 4 minutes and staff wrote the letter C on back of my ticket and people around me. They write a letter, number or whatever on everyone's ticket. It goes by grouping. Based on what I saw and what I asked you're not given a specific letter based on how you look, if you're wearing an Indiana sweatshirt or anything like that. You then go into the outer lobby in a group of about 20 people or so until that space is filled, a few staff members asked if everyone was excited, who traveled farthest and things like that. They go over what will happen, policies, etc. That lasted about 5 minutes. Since it was raining they told us to be in the 3 Monkeys bar around the corner by 3:35pm and Letterman staff would be there to bring us over to the theater. It was about 3pm or so now so I went to the bar, had a drink and talked with other people going to the show. Not sure if they do that on non-rainy days but it's a good spot to pass the time. There were Letterman staff at the bar when I walked in, told me to listen for announcements in a half hour or so. Around that time they got on the microphone in the bar and started calling over other groups (A, B and one other that I forget, wasn't a letter though). About 4pm they called C group, we lined up and all walked over and got in line outside the theater. Again they did their best to keep us all out of the rain. I didn't take one but they even had a few umbrellas that they had let people borrow if they wanted. They told us we would be going through a metal detector so to get anything metal out of our pockets and if you had a backpack or bag have it opened and take it off your back. Have your ticket out. There were about 40 people ahead of me when I got in line for the metal detector but it took me only about 10 minutes until I was through the metal detector. The explosives-sniffing dog and handler walk around throughout this process and were checking bags etc. Once you're through the detector, you're in and you just walk ahead, hand off your ticket (take a photo earlier if you want because you won't get it back after this point) and everything moves quickly at this point. Staff is asking how many in you're party, I said one, they direct you to the next staffer and I was lucky on this day because our C group was on the orchestra level (there's a mezzanine level that was already filled when I walked in) and they put me in an aisle seat 3 rows from the band. So basically where you sit is pretty much all up to luck of the draw. Alan Kalter the announcer was already talking to the audience at this point going over stuff such as the signals he'd use for when to applaud, etc. There are no applause signs which I liked. I also thought he was hysterical, some really funny one liners while he was explaining everything. He introduces the band one-by-one and they start playing. The one thing that surprised me about the entire day was how unbelievably good the band is. Eventually Dave comes out before the show, took some questions from the audience for about 10 minutes and started showing an old unedited clip of him and Richard Simmons that had everyone laughing. He goes off-stage and within a couple minutes he's being announced and the show's starting. Monologue, break, Top 10 list and skit or two, break, and so on. The guests were Ben Stiller and Olivia Munn and the singer was Lala Brooks and all 3 were great. During breaks the band plays full songs which were all excellent. I didn't realize what good voices some of the band members had. Based on where you're seated, there may be cameras or equipment blocking your view of Dave or the guest, but again that's luck of the draw. There are plenty of screens everywhere for you to see what's going on. It's free and it's being taped for TV so as long as you realize it's not a Broadway play with perfect views of everyone on stage at all times you'll be fine. During one of the returns from a break they show the entire audience quickly so there's a good chance you'll see yourself on TV that night, but it is not guaranteed. I saw myself when it aired but thankfully for the sake of everyone's eyeballs it was only a quick shot of me. The other thing I liked when I got to watch the show that actually aired was what they cut out and how they cut different things. The best part was after Olivia Munn's interview they started getting ready for Lala Brooks who had brought a drummer, keyboardist, violinists and singers with her. Paul Shaffer and his band were playing during all this setup and eventually when Lala Brooks' people were all set up they all started joining in and kept playing together for a good 5 or 10 minutes. This wasn't stuff to be aired, they just kept going and going. I looked over at one point and Dave and some staff were just sitting and standing around watching this and enjoying it as much as the audience. It was great. They did the intro for Lala Brooks and they had to re-start the song a few times to get the musicians synched up but it was interesting to see how when it aired that night they edited it to be smooth as could be. After the show ends, Dave thanks the audience and that's it, staff directs people out. I suppose everyone's experience depends on where they sit and who the guests are so I know I was lucky in that sense and even some staff members were saying after the show that it was one of the best shows they could remember taping due in large part to the great music that night. I was back outside by about 6pm. Some random info and reminders: -There were several people with backpacks and umbrellas and there's an area to check them in right before you get seated and you pick them up after the taping. -I was wearing a rain jacket and I stuffed it under my seat before the taping, it fit fine. -If you want a photo of your ticket take it in the down time after getting your ticket and before you return to the theater. They collect them and you don't get them back when you enter the theater. -Use the bathroom before going into the taping. I heard someone say that there are bathrooms accessible from the mezzanine level only and only during commercial breaks. I wasn't up there and didn't have to use it anyways so plan accordingly. -The staff you'll be dealing with are mostly young pages who were all very friendly. They were all a good group so don't be afraid to ask them anything. -No photography at any time anywhere in the building and completely turn off your cellphone for the entire taping. -The only complaint I heard on the way walking out after the taping was people saying they couldn't see because of cameras. That is the same at any TV taping since that's what they're doing it for, so realize that going in and you'll be fine. I've attended a Tonight Show taping and it's the same there. The seating is random so enjoy it if you get a clear view.",Solo,0,0,Dance,Boston,NA,No,0,"Great Music, Dave is super friendly"

It's a combination TV show, concert and stand-up (as they have a separate warm-up comedian). You certainly get more out of the show in-person vs. watching on TV. Letterman was great. He talks with the audience before the show, then (as it turns out) incorporates some of the audience conversations into his jokes on TV, which was real nice. One lady who asked him a question before the show found herself in the Top 10. I sat in the upper-section. There's an advantage and disadvantage to that. The advantage is the view. It's unobstructed at all-times. On the lower-level, you're much closer to Dave and the set, but when the show actually starts, cameras and other equipment obstruct your view. On the upper-level, you always see everything. The disadvantage (for me) was a lack of interaction. All of the interaction with Dave was focused on the lower-level, so we didn't feel as a part of the show sitting up high. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. Everything from the pages, band, warm-up comedian, and Dave himself was great! It's amazing to see how much work is constantly going on in the background to put the show on TV.

I phoned the standby ticket number starting at 11 and got through after about 5 minutes. My name was taken, I was given my number (6), and told to show up at 3:30. I arrived a few minutes early and there were a few other people waiting in the standby line, while some of those with pre-ordered tickets were being let into the theatre. As it was cold outside, we were quickly escorted inside and told to line up in order of our number. The page was very energetic and made some silly jokes, but it was all in good fun. After a few minutes during which the standby line filled up, we were told that tickets were available for us! Each of us was handed a ticket with S on the back and we were then moved over to the Three Monkeys Bar to wait to get into the theater, again because it was cold out. Inside the bar, there was a guy getting the crowd ready and explaining the rules. Eventually those with B tickets were escorted back to the theater, then C tickets, then the standbys. At this time, about 45 minutes had passed, and we knew the show would start at 4:30 on the spot, so there was little waiting. Entering the theater requires walking through a metal detector and they do have a bag check if you are carrying something large. You then walk into the actual theater and are directed to a seat, I was fortunate to get an aisle seat in the center section, although I don't think there are any bad seats down low. When we entered, the warm-up comic was mostly done, but we got the final instructions, mainly to make noise and applaud. At no point was I told to laugh as I've read in other reviews. The band was introduced and played a song, then announcer Alan Kalter appeared, Paul came out followed by Dave, who talked with the crowd for about 5 minutes. Just as he finished up, the taping began, and he ran back to put on his suit jacket before reappearing to start the actual show. During the show, it was very interesting to watch how everything operates, there are a couple of dozen stagehands and other people running around, especially during the commercials. I recommend the standby option if you are pressed for time and you would be OK with missing the show. As mentioned, I showed up at 3:30, and people were being let in to the theater already. These people probably arrived an hour earlier if the other reviews are accurate, and then had to wait while the remaining patrons were seated. The show ended around 5:40. Of course, standby doesn't guarantee tickets, but you can pick which guests you want to see as the Letterman website lists that week's guests every Monday. Just start phoning at 11 am. If you don't get in, you just lose 30 minutes waiting to find out. All-in-all, great fun that cost me not a single penny. Letterman's sense of humor may not be for everyone, but I found him to be charming and adept at keeping the conversation going when the guest struggled to be interesting. Will definitely come back.",Solo,0,0,Dance,New York City,NA,No,0,"Easy, fun, and free."

A couple weeks before traveling to NYC to finish out mortuary school I had applied online for tickets. A few days before arriving in town I received a call from The Late Show promotions department offering two tickets. Needless to say I was ecstatic. The problem I ran into was that my classes for the day our tickets were for, Tuesday, were not to let out until 3pm. The LS staff needed us there before 3. The theater was just a few blocks from my school. Needless to say the school said there would be no early dismissal. Regrettably I had to pass on the tickets. Here's where it gets good; when Tuesday rolled around, I of course, went to my classes. At 2:15 the instructor said unexpectedly, ""Ok, that's it, see everyone tomorrow"" I sat stunned. I quickly ran out of the building, caught a cab down to the Port Authority to meet up with my wife, caught another cab; and made a mad dash to the Ed Sullivan Theater. We were told that we could be placed on a ""standby"" list for tickets if any would be left for the evening's show. Long and the short of it; we waited around the corner with a group of people, all hoping to get it ... We GOT IN!! #36 & 37 of 39. Our seats were in the last row in the upper left of the balcony right above the sound board for the orchestra. Could not see Paul Shaffer, but we knew he was there. We had a ""reasonable"" view of the set and of course Dave. Billy Crystal and Connie Chen were Dave's guest.

The calibre of the cast was top notch! The singing, dancing, acting, costumes and set really made the show a great experience.

With great choreography and fantastic execution this story of the Newsies of lower Manhattan is told with great energy. The creative set is simple but brings every part of the city to life on the stage. Look for some of your favorites from So You Think You Can Dance in the Cast. The orchestra section of the theater is very small and below stage level. I would recommend seats in the first row of the balcony or in one of the side boxes.,Group,0,0,Dance,Orlando,NA,No,0,Go and See This Show

This Studio, formerly a masterpiece of colonial architecture, has been transformed into an architectural work of art. The Gallery itself and several outbuildings dance with the color of Pen Cayetano's brush strokes. Inside the buildings, the visitor may be overcome by the artworks displayed by both Pen and Ingrid. Pen, an internationally famous artist and musician, works mostly in oil on canvas to tell stories of his ancestral past while Ingrid spins her tales using the techniques of needlepainting, application and assemblage. Indeed, Pen and Ingrid are a memorable couple, bright and friendly, eager to share their works with others. They are notable educators, opening their Gallery to local boys and girls and inviting them to explore their shared past. If you are visiting Dangriga or just passing through, find the time to track down the Studio Gallery Cayetano. It is easy to find and well worth it.",Group,0,0,Dance,Waterford,NA,No,0,"When you visit Dangriga, you must not leave till you have seen the Studio Gallery Cayetano."
