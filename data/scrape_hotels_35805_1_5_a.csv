The experience was phenomenal - this is a luxury hotel at it's best. The location is perfect for exploring Chicago - next to a load of restaurants and the best shopping district. Check-in was friendly and personal and they gave me an early check-in and late check-out until 5.30pm - something I really appreciate in luxury hotels. I think the hotel has recently undergone a refurbishment as far and away the best part of the hotel is the rooms. They literally have the perfect bedrooms in terms of layout, decor, bed, TV and amazing technology - everything is remote control and they even have a printer in every room. I especially loved the dressing area. Here are some of the amenities I took advantage of: - Highly recommend the pool! Beautiful. - I had a massage at the spa, was lovely but not unmissable, so you can skip unless you're addicted to massages like me. - Afternoon tea was good, the service was lovely, the food and value for money were ok for USA standards, but nothing comes close to a true English afternoon tea in London. The one disappointment was the concierge. An elderly gentleman helped me but he was incredibly miserable, rude and condescending when I was suggesting ideas. A smile goes a long way. But the rooms alone make me give this hotel 5 stars - I am now a Peninsula fan!",Solo,,Belgium,Dance,Brussels,NA,No,02/08,The perfect luxury rooms!

First, the positives: 1: What a great location, slap bang in the middle of things. When you walk out in the morning and see the skyscrapers it is almost unreal. 2: The rooms are lovely, very stylish and impeccably clean. 3: The whole place is slightly quirky but in a good way. It is not your typical corporate hotel and we were very pleased with the quality of everything there. There were a small number of things that affected our stay: 1: It is right next to a corner on the Loop. Even though we were on the 16th floor and they provided ear plugs it is a real issue. An additional layer of glass might do the job, alternatively some oil for the trains!!! 2: The staff are picked for their hipster credentials rather than their customer service. I like the typical over the top welcome and hospitality that the Americans do so well. Just felt the staff were more about their piercings, hair and leather than they were about customer service and found them cursory and slightly rude on a couple of occasions. If this is what cool is, then perhaps it isn't for people like me. 3: The roof terrace was closed for all the nights we were there (we arrived very late on the Saturday. Would have appreciated another area to relax but, as it was, the lift won't even allow you to go to the top floor when it isn't open. 4: The mini bar selection was great but it's not the street food prices that I'd read about. Totally appreciate that this is probably necessary but I needed to adjust my expectations after all I'd read. In conclusion. It's a wonderful hotel and I think it sets a new standard in alternative approaches to running hotels but there are a few wrinkles that need ironed out.",Couples,,NA,Dance,London,NA,No,08/13,Very good but a couple of issues that need addressed

I have never been to a hotel where every single member of staff has been so very friendly and appear to really enjoy working here. Where to begin.... I arrived about 7.45pm. They have a bar called Commons Club where drinks and cocktails are served free of charge to all guests between 7/8pm. Snacks available to buy. I was told to go straight up and have a drink - music to my ears! My room was lovely. As you walk into the room it is really 1 large room that can be divided into 2 with sliding doors. First is the dressing room area, bathroom and huge shower. Some of the lights come on automatically which can be a pain if you get up in the night for a pee and don't want to put the light on so you don't really wake up! I am a light sleeper and it's right on top of The Loop (train) and the noise kept me awake - that must be why there were ear plugs in the room! However in the morning they changed my room to a much higher floor and to the back of the hotel. I could still hear the train but I really can't reduce my rating of this hotel because everything else about it was so good and I expect most people wouldn't even notice the noise. They have a hostess who walks around and is their Woman in Red (Virgin brand) however i still think she should be called Lady in Red. The hotel has a house car - a Tesla - available to drive guests anywhere within a 2 miles radius from 8/11am and 4/8pm. I mostly travel alone and have been made to feel so very welcome here with staff coming up to me to check I'm ok all the time. I can't name them all because there are so many but Ray, Thadius, Marguerite, Zac, Xavier, James are some of the guys I have met who have been super nice. I am sure I have forgotten something but I expect you are bored by now so here are a couple of photos of my room plus one from my first room showing how near the train is.

From check in to check out our experience was 5* all the way. The room: Room 1504 was one of the hotel's ""King Spa Premier"" rooms. The bed was very comfortable with quality and spotless linens. The room was a good size with a seating area (desk, couch, chair and table) as well as the sleeping area. Our room was a corner room so we had two sided views to the south and east. The bathroom was GREAT. The two person jetted spa tub really does fit two people, the shower has great pressure, is high enough for the 6'6"" types and is done up with high quality finishes. The bath products were of high quality. Housekeeping managed to keep this huge bathroom (as well as the rest of the room and hotel) spotless. Easier said than done; kudos to them. It should also be noted that this is one of the quietest rooms I've ever been in even though it had floor to ceiling windows over busy Chicago on two sides. The hallway noise was minimal, the outside noise was non-existent and it gave the room an oasis-like feel. This is a HUGE plus for those of us getting away from kids and noise for a few days. Ammenities: A cold snap prevented us from taking advantage of the roof top al fresco area but I'd bet that in July that spot is as nice as it gets; the lobby lounge area is well appointed with comfortable seating and a large area for many groups. 5pm is free wine hour with new labels daily. Free coffee and tea reside in the wine's spot every morning as well. Staff: The front desk staff was friendly, professional and knowledgable. Very helpful with directions, extra towels, etc... The door staff was above and beyond what one would expect. Friendly, professional, likeable and knowledgable (restaurants, bars, directions, where to avoid, who to see, etc). I cannot speak highly enough of them; they were as good as, if not better than, any front desk/bell staff I've ever encountered. Location: Far enough from Michigan Ave to seem less touristy but right in the middle of the action. A perfect location as far as I'm concerned. $30 Uber to/from O'Hare, $10 to Au Cheval, $11 to Hamilton/Privatebank Theatre.

I stay here or at least try and find time to stay at the Palomar at least twice a month if I am in Illinois and since I have been back here in Illinois for quite some time this review is about my stay during one of our blizzards during January where Aretha Franklin was forced to cancer her concert and this review is based on my most recent stay yesterday. First of all try and visit Chicago during our worst weather seasons because the Palomar is a ""treat"" and you will fall in love with the Staff. Mark has known me for quite some time now and not only is he genuinely kind and enthusiastic but he has a great knowledge of the city of Chicago and will help you plan something special. Sam also works at the front desk and she is genuinely kind as she greets you in at check in and check out. Honestly the staff here at this location is some of the friendliest and they are quite good at what they do. During January's blizzard the rates here dropped and I scheduled a spa room with a tub for two as a treat and of course if you come here please do not miss wine hour because wine hour at the Palomar is special. The guests congregate in the comfortable living room area with comfortable couches and a cozy fireplace to get wine, water and flat bread. You will not wish to miss the flat bread because it's so delicious and you can also order an entire flat bread at their restaurant Sable which I love visiting on the ground floor. All the rooms here are cozy but the premier spa suites with a view are the most beautiful and the jacuzzi tubs are so huge you can actually sink down into them with water hitting your neck. There is so much room in the tubs you can fit a total of THREE people in there so if you want to have a romantic evening with your partner I do recommend the spa rooms with the jacuzzi jet tubs. Sable is relaxing and the chef might even visit your table if it's quiet. During the blizzard in January the chef did come to my table and rewarded me with a complimentary dessert to try for being an inner circle member. I decided to try a small sampling of everything so I decided on the tiny portion of chicken and waffles which were so delicious and served with home made maple syrup and I sampled their heavy macaroni and cheese and topped off my meal with truffle fries. I must say I made some excellent choices and I will be back for seconds soon! The dessert was a deconstructed sweet potato pie that came in layers and was so rich and filling I had to take half of it upstairs with me to my room to eat while I picked out a movie to watch. There are so many good movies to choose from so you can relax in your room, nibble on good food and watch the newest movies going on in all the theaters. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and their wonderful staff so I am just going to end this review by encouraging everyone visiting Chicago to pick the Palomar not only for its great location but because it's luxurious without being stuffy and you will feel like it's your second home.",Solo,18,NA,Dance,New Orleans,NA,No,04/09,"Decadence, comfort, Coziness, charming spa like Oasis"

It's located conveniently close to the Loop and the Magnificent Mile shopping area. It's also close to the Red line el train. The hotel seems to be in a new building (as of Dec. 2016 when I'm writing this) which also is a condo or apartment building. It's located close to so many restaurants and bars. This is a big plus! I had a ""View"" room, however, the view wasn't that great. My room faced West which yields a very unglamorous view of lower-level uninteresting buildings to the west of downtown. I didn't have a view I of the core downtown or river that I was anticipating. My room was very clean and modern. It's so modern that it took me a white to figure out how to turn on the lights. I did appreciate the design of the room and the furniture. Due to the busy-ness of the hotel (i was there the weekend before Christmas), I always had to wait for an elevator. Many times I was on the elevator, the bell captains would push the heavy-laden luggage carts onto the elevator with their departing guests. I was amazed at how many people still use bell captains these days! The front-desk staff was very friendly and cordial upon check-in and check-out. Also, the check-in/out process was pretty quick and efficient, too. A major plus! The Wi-Fi signal was pretty strong. However, since it is an un-secure connection, I couldn't browse several sites on my updated iOS and macOS devices (I hadn't had this experience before, so I'm wondering if recent updates to iOS and macOS prevent using the internet if on an un-secure network). I didn't take advantage of the free happy hour during the evenings. Since the hotel is so close to many great Chicago bars and restaurants, I was usually out at a nearby tavern for happy hour. :-) I used to stay at Kimpton's Burnham Hotel which I liked quite a bit more. However, Kimpton sold that property and it is now another hotel chain. I'm honestly not sure I'd stay at the Palomar again. There's really nothing wrong with the hotel. Perhaps I was expecting better views out the windows. Views usually aren't a big deal for me - but in a city like Chicago with all the spectacular architecture, I was hoping for something more.

I am a stickler for cleanliness in this Hotel checks all the boxes. It is beautifully designed with Sleek lines and a modern touch. The rooms are a good size and and the bathrooms are amazing. Everything is so open and bright. The lounge/bar and restaurant area was very nice also there were areas where you can sit comfortably in cushy couches or chairs or sit around the bar. I did not get to eat in the restaurant but it seems like it gets really busy and people were making reservations. They have a happy hour between 5 and 8 on weekdays with really great specials. Another really important factor is how the staff treat you there. They greet you when you come off of the elevator and are very attentive to your needs. Location is excellent. It is a block away from Michigan Avenue and across the street from Buckingham Fountain and Grant Park. The hotel is a couple of blocks east of State Street where there is great shopping. The area has endless restaurant options and a Starbucks right on the corner which is imperative... I got a great rate when booking on TripAdvisor. There was a 48 hour special which worked out very well. They also had a special going on for Cubs fans but it wasn't available on my dates of stay. I also got upgraded to a higher floor when I checked in which was nice. This hotel has no views so if you're looking for that it's not the place to stay, but everything else there makes up for that.

Close to coffee shops, restaurants, etc. as well so you don't need to walk far to get anything.

The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, the room itself could have easily accommodated two people. My only con? The walls seemed to be a bit thin. On the last night there I could hear the TV of the room next to me, nothing too crazy loud but it was on all night.

I called the hotel a week later to let them know we were coming in for my boyfriends birthday and he was also born on Valentine's Day and I was wondering if they did anything special or if there were any packages. Without hesitation the person I spoke to on the phone upgraded our room and arranged for wine to be sent up to our room! I was so happy! I couldn't believe it! I wanted the room to be a surprise for my boyfriend but we are really bad at keeping secrets so I told him and he got super excited! We are originally from Michigan and we didn't know if it would be cheaper to take the train or to drive so my dad helped me out and he called the hotel and they mentioned if I book through them, they would give me the same room, same deal and they would discount parking for our entire stay. I spoke to Robert from Kinzie Hotel that night and he was so sweet and so nice. Everything that he said would be apart of our stay was so awesome! I felt like a celebrity! He was helpful, he was calm when I got a tiny bit agitated because I wanted this birthday to be perfect and I was getting a little stressed out. After our phone call I was confident that this trip was going to be unforgettable. I stayed in contact with the hotel via email and they responded to my emails very quickly, even at 2 am! Now, to our hotel room. I couldn't believe it. It had a living room and a bedroom, two tv's a spacious bathroom with a vanity mirror and bench (that was my favorite part) the blinds were automatic and it was so luxurious. Usually walking into hotel so fancy as this one you feel a little intimidated walking in with untied boots, messy hair, looking like I just rolled out of bed but the front desk was so nice and so funny that I felt comfortable like I've been there for days. We got 8 complimentary drinking tokens and the concierge was giving us the run down of the amenities, where the lounge is, when breakfast is, etc. and when he was all done with his speech he quizzed us! I was laughing so hard by the time we got into the elevator because we both weren't listening and he knew that. He kept us in our toes! I really enjoyed that! There was nothing negative about our stay at this hotel. I felt like all my questions were dumb but they politely helped me and told me ""no worries!"" I walked out of there feeling like a new person. I have found the hotel that I will always be staying at when I come into town.

I am both picky and potentially a snob...I want to be impressed and I want to be comfortable. I like a well executed boutique feel and Kinzie had it. I was impressed with Kinzie for: 1. cleanliness. great housekeeping. 2. a very nice continental breakfast - it was a broad assortment and maintained 3.good customer service (communication thru text was offered and welcomed) and 4. location to good eateries. FYI: I did not park at the hotel but did park down the street. I found the down the street parking to be reasonable not cheap. Cons: 1. The shower is not much better than good/average. No light in the shower and having a dual Speakman showerhead was a bit much in a smaller shower space. The bathroom was well presented otherwise. 2. cable/tv was a bit annoying and didn't offer paid programming.,Solo,14,Massachusetts,Dance,Boston,M,No,10/10,Lovely boutique hotel with style

The room I was assigned to originally did indeed have a river view, but no window seat bench. Luckily I was able to speak with the front desk and there was a room available that had one. Aside from this, the room was clean and served as a comfortable retreat after a day of walking and taking in the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago. The amenities offered in the hotel were great as well; from the wine reception to the hot chocolate that was available each and everyday.

A few minutes later, housekeeping came by to ask when I was checking out. I said I'd just checked in. Maybe they hadn't finished cleaning, it's not clear, but obviously a breakdown in their service processes. The rooms are eccentric (half-size double doors to the bathroom?), and dated, but the public spaces still look great. Later, I called to borrow an iPhone cord, which I forgot. I was told they were only available for purchase. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I was surprised. Other hotels, like Virgin, have accommodated the same request with no problem. When I mentioned it at check-out, I was told that they cannot keep charging cords for all their rooms. What? I only asked for one cord, not one for all their rooms! Supply does not work like that! I also discovered that what I had verbally understood as the charge for the suite was only the upgrade charge, on top of the original room charge. The response was to pull out a sheet of paper showing I signed that it was a surcharge (or supplement in their parlance). OK, my error. But I would not have expected it to be handled quite so legalistically. Just apologize for the misunderstanding, and make some conciliatory statement, like 'we'll try to do better in clearly describing the upgrade rates during check-in.' At no point during check-in did they quote the total rate before tax. Regardless, their service seems to be centered on policies, not customers.

The bar tender was attentive and swift in his service and willingly reduced the volume of the music when requested, as it was just a little too loud to hear one another talk. We had breakfast in the adjoining bakery on one morning, and it was adequate, although the service was a bit sleepy.

I reserved a spa room for my wife and I for our anniversary weekend getaway. At the time of reservation they had no problem taking my credit card information for the reservation s but when we arrived to said hotel that was a different story we showed up to get the keys and enjoy our night together when they said that they would not except my card that I made the reservation with due to it being a prepaid card. Which is not specified in any part of the fine print in the contract of the reservation. So the first worker said that they just need a card with a name on it and it could be paid for with the original card. We told they not to change anything to that card as we did not have enough money on that card and no way to transfer funds for one account to the other since we were over three hours away from home and it was late on Saturday night. So they ran it it did not go through and the worked was told to cancel the transaction .He said he did and left to come back with a front end manager. Whom said that we could pay in cash so I went and pulled all the money I could for the day out of their ATM to cover the cost of the room and as I went to pay cash she told me it would be an additional $500.00 for the room because I was paying with cash. At this time my wife was fed up with the way that we had been treated by the worker and the front end manager that she stormed out and as I told them to just cancel the room the front end manager had no remorse for the situation and basically stated that it was not their fault and was unwilling to help in any way. So we even had to pay for the 1 hour long parking in their garage I was so disappointed in the way that they looked down on us and that they made it feel that we should not be staying there to begin with. And that hurt even more so my wife and I scrambled to find another hotel in the area at 7 pm at night and came across a wonderful hotel called the Parker House and it was a beautiful historical hotel much better than what I seem from the Trump hotel. They were more than happy to help us get the room and take care of us. But what was even worse is that the Trump hotel CHARGED US THE FEE FOR THE REGISTRATION TWO DAY LATER.... So we called our bank to see what the charge was and through our bank we even called the Hotel and the manager stated that that situation never happened and that we were charged as a no show and refused to refund the fee....So we were charged for the night and did not even stay there.. I will never recommend any of my friends or business partners that travel and stay in Chicago to stay at this establishment. And they all agree and will be spending there time and money at great hotel like Parker House while doing business in Chicago......I hope that they will see this and try to make it right but I will not hold my breath.....,Couples,,NA,Dance,,NA,Yes,02/15,Anniversary disaster

This could be the nicest hotel I ever stayed in. The design is very modern with extremely comfortable beds. It's located on Wabash just North of the Chicago River. You're walking distance to downtown restaurants and bars, the Magnificent Mile shopping district and the Lakefront to name a few. You'll never get bored in Chicago. One side of the hotel is for owners and the other side for hotel guests. The service is equally pleasant for both groups. Honestly, I didn't know what turndown service was and embarrassed myself. Be careful what you eat or drink in the stocked refrigerator. The cheapest item in there was a $7 water. A bottle of water sits on a night stand for $125. The room rates vary depending on holiday weekends or local events. Average per night is around $300 at the lowest and up to $700 for a standard king room. City taxes and hotel fees add another $60 to your bill. Hotel parking was around $52/day. Some rooms have a nicer view of the Chicago River. The others have nice views of the River North skyline. The rooftop bar is captivating but not open year round due to weather. What impressed me most was the tv in the bathroom mirror. At first I thought it was a security camera until I found the remote and turned it on. Secondly, the full kitchen with stovetop, dishwasher and REAL dishes. A Bose radio is standard for most luxury hotels. Your name appears on the tv screen to welcome you. Trump slippers and bath robes are a nice touch. Free wifi is available for hotel guests.

The decor is a bit more plain than I remembered. The bed was lovely with two individual comforters that were fluffy and good smelling. No top sheet? It was so warm sleeping (even with the room temp turned down to 66), that in the middle of the night we had to go looking for a sheet and blanket in the closet. We found a set in a sealed plastic cover that, when opened, smelled musty/dusty and obviously had never been used. Having said that, we loved the pineapple logos embroidered on the blanket, as well as a pillow on the bed. The Tommy Bahama bath products are also pineapply/coconuty. And there are chilled pineapple infused water dispensers in the lobby. Good job with the branding Staypineapple company! We were a bit disappointed in the redesign of the Atwood Cafe in the hotel lobby, but that is for another review. The front desk staff were great and the valet/bell captain (I wish I would have gotten his name) was so helpful and accommodating. Our only issue was with a mix up upon arriving. I called the day before and talked to a young lady and asked if the valet for the car would be on Washington or State street. She did not know so put me on hold for at least 4 minutes then came back with an answer: State St. So when we pulled up to the corner and turned on to Sate St we were in a marked 'loading zone'. I ran over to the hotel entrance (on Washington) and was told that we would have to go around the block to meet the valet back on Washington. Later I told the valet and front desk about my conversation on the phone and they were perplexed. Maybe evidence of the new establishment? Employee training?

Also, if you are on the side of the hotel with the CTA stop as we were, you are going to hear the subway trains, no getting around that.

The hotel is all-new, and is located just west of the Crate and Barrel store, which means it is a perfect location to walk to anyplace on the Magnificent Mile. The staff was helpful, well informed, and unfailingly pleasant from the first moment I came in from the cold blowing down Eire Street. Throughout my stay, several greeted me by name when I walked through the reception areas. Obviously this staff have been well trained to provide luxury level service at every interaction, yet they made it look effortless. There was none of that annoying vending and “cross-selling” that too many hotels feel they may inflict on their visitors. I felt like a valued guest, not a data point for a customer list. I’ve stayed at a few Conrad hotels—most are nicely decorated—but the Conrad Chicago is exceptional. Tasteful, elegant and restrained—but not so understated as to risk blandness or be “too safe.” The Chicago Conrad avoids the kind of dullness which passes for sophistication in some other hotels (including in some other Conrads.) The use of woods, fabrics, color and art is pleasing. My room (a standard) was pleasant, large enough, and with a large sofa. Even though I was alone for this trip, I appreciated that the bathroom was designed so that two could use it at the same time. The shower was large and sleek. The soaps, lotions and other amenities are high quality and generously sized—I forgot you need tons of skin lotion when visiting Chicago in the dryness of January, so I was grateful. The guest room was well engineered. For example, the sheers and blackout curtains are motorized and raise or lower at the touch of a bedside button. Excellent lighting; you could dim it when relaxing or make the whole room very bright to work or to get dressed. (Yes, I am a bit of a complainer about bad hotel lighting if rooms have dark areas.) Plenty of outlets for a laptop, phone or tablet, but no true desk area. Nice view of Michigan Avenue and beyond. The room and hallways were dead silent. Restaurant/café areas are adjacent to the lobby and repeat the open and sophisticated design. Great city views, but I did not eat there. I have stayed at several Magnificent Mile hotels, and yes, I would definitely choose the Chicago Conrad on a return visit. BTW, I was at first confused when I heard that this was a brand new hotel, so here is a word of explanation to other occasional travelers to Chicago. The original Chicago Conrad was located west of the Nordstrom’s. That property is no longer a Conrad hotel.

You set the bar high, and you exceeded all my expectations. Thank you for your expert and friendly registration desk, your top notch housekeeping, a room service which has no equals (do thank April for steering me to the Root Beer Float :), your courteous doormen and bell staff, and the sheer beauty, comfortableness, and location of the hotel. Next visit, I must arrive closer to the check in time. Train travel isn't always ""arrival time accommodating) so I chose to accept a comparable suite on a lower floor rather than wait for the 19th floor corner suite you had pre-selected for me.

One of the most cost-effective places in the city on a night of inflated prices - convenient location, great space, and excellent staff! Room was spacious and comfortable, well appointed. Overall decor capitalizes on the art deco theme of the original building very nicely. Mini-fridge in the room a bonus, as was the view of the corner of Wacker Place & Michigan Avenue. Lobby includes a small bar, and a mini-mart that offers standard beverages, adult beverages, frozen meals/snacks and a microwave. Staff was all pleasant and extremely helpful, and very mindful of guest comfort and security. Lobby activity was closely watched (especially late at night), and smoking in the hotel (a non-smoking facility) and late-night party noise was not tolerated. Location is super-convenient and easy walking distance to a ton of shopping and sight-seeing musts in the city. It's easy to overlook this place - it's on a short block between Wabash/Wacker & Michigan Ave. It's marked, but the signage really blends in (I misjudged the entrance and walked into the Hilton Garden Inn that's right next door!) With the location comes some traffic noise, but there's no helping that, especially on NYE - the hotel even posted with each check-in that they had earplugs available if the noise got to be too much for you! If I'm doing a ""staycation"", I like to try for something a little more ""luxe"", but for one night on a mission to see the NYE fireworks in person, this place was PERFECT for my needs.
