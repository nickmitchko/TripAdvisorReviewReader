I always enjoy every time we go. There are many different exhibites to walk through, each giving you a different place, culture, and history to learn about. They also have exhibites that are available only for a certain amount of time. If you plan on going, check out the website first to plan your visit. I recommend getting their at open because you will spend the whole day there. There is a parking garage at the stadium you can use for a fee. If you have kids and want to save money then you can always pack a lunch and drink because food is very expensive to purchase. There is lockers to rent, sitting areas, cafeteria to have your lunch at. They also have elevators and it's wheel chair accessible. They have 3D movies available to watch also plus gift shops.

While I am more fond of the artists from Chicago, they do have collective works from artists originating in other parts of the USA, as well as south of the border. When we went this time, their 'Day of the Dead' exhibit was up and running. It is endearing. The tribute to the Orlando night club victims was incredible. There was a tribute to Selena. I also liked the other art there that I saw today. One of my favorites was the exhibit of Sun Mad. It is a visual eulogy. So when you look at it one the one side, she looks alive; when you walk over to the other side, she is a skeleton. Exquisite. I thought the Disney reference was palpable and it even gave me a chuckle. This place is very wheel chair accessible. There are places to sit, as you walk around. They have nice bathrooms inside and a gift shop with books and other items of art. There is no restaurant inside, but plenty around the block in the area, especially on 18th street.

For years, we have walked past the International Museum of Surgical Science at 1524 North Lake Shore Drive, which is located only two blocks from our condominium on the Gold Coast. We admired the lakeside mansion and vowed several times to visit the museum. But it took an article in the Chicago Sun-Times to make it happen. According to the full-page article, the museum is in the early planning stages to unveil an exhibit on sex reassignment surgery by the end of 2017. A study reveals 700,000 people in the United States identify as transgender and it is estimated that between 100 and 500 sex change procedures are performed each year in this country. Such an exhibit would be in keeping with the mission of the museum, which is operated by the International College of Surgeons. Established in 1954 by Dr. Max Thorek, the four-story mansion houses more than 7,000 medical artifacts. It is the only museum specifically dedicated to medical surgery in North America. It tells the story of the evolution of surgical practices from the early days of trepanation and bloodletting to more modern achievements in pain management, transplants and avoiding infections in surgery. Its displays include photographs, paintings, drawings, sculpture, medical equipment, skeletons, medical specimens and historic artifacts that interpret the pre-modern and modern healing practices of human civilization. From early practices to today's revolutionary techniques, the museum's collections and exhibits portray the mysteries, breakthroughs, failures and milestones that have shaped modern surgical science. Exhibits currently on view include: Wound Healing: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Techniques; A World Without Polio; Nursing: Care For A Changing World; Pain And Pain Management; Obstetrics And Gynecology; X-Rays; and Windows On The World: The Science Of Sight And The Ophthalmic Art. The building itself is a museum piece. It was built in 1917 by Howard Van Doren Shaw for Chicago socialite Eleanor Robinson Countiss Whitney, who died in 1931. Her old billiards room is the museum's library that contains more than 5,000 rare medical texts. The mansion was designed after Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI's Le Petit Trianon in Versailles. The International College of Surgeons acquired the building in 1950. In addition to displaying medical artifacts, the museum has, since 1998, hosted a number of contemporary art exhibitions in an effort to broaden its appeal to visitors. Its projected exhibit on sex assignment surgery is sure to attract more interest.",Couples,,Illinois,Dance,Chicago,M,No,07/12,The only museum dedicated to medical surgery in North America

So my first real association with African Americans came in 1968 when I became high school sports editor of the Chicago Daily News and began covering football and basketball games on Chicago's South Side on a regular basis. It was a fascinating education, especially because I was learning during the tumultuous era surrounding the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I had heard about the Du Sable Museum of African American History, which was established in 1961, but I didn't visit until almost 10 years later. At first, it was out of curiosity, to see how much I didn't know and how much I still had to learn. But in the wake of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington's death and other recent events that impacted on black (and white) history, a visit to the Du Sable Museum was a way of keeping up with the times. The Du Sable Museum is the first and oldest museum dedicated to the study and conservation of African American history, culture and art. It was founded in 1961 by Dr. Margaret Taylor Burroughs and others. Located at 740 East 56th Place at the corner of Cottage Grove on Chicago's South Side in the Washington Park neighborhood, it was renamed for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable in 1968. Du Sable was a Haitian fur trader and the first non-Native American permanent settler in Chicago. The new 25,000-square-foot wing contains a permanent exhibit on Harold Washington with memorabilia, personal effects and other highlights of his political career. The museum has a collection of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, art objects and memorabilia. There is a 466-seat auditorium, part of the new wing, that hosts community-related events, including jazz and blues music series, poetry readings and film screenings. There also is a gift shop and research library. Besides the Harold Washington exhibit, other interesting exhibits include a history of blacks in the Armed Forces and paintings, drawings and sculptures of black artists, the story of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, Thomas Miller mosaics and the Freedom Now mural, carvings that illustrate 400 years of African American history including such notables as Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois and Mary Mcleod Bethune and the 1981 Nate Turner-led slave revolt. It's a lot of history that blacks and whites need to comprehend and understand.",Couples,,Illinois,Dance,Chicago,M,No,07/12,A must stop for exploring Black history

It's not busy at all, which is a shame. I imagine due to its location. It's not where most touristic locations are. At the first level, the main entrance, you will see a few art pieces by african american artists. What I appreciated the most about this museum was the interactive Mayor Harold Washington exhibit. I've never seen it done in any museum I've been to - not even madame tussauds. A very interactive, as close to the real thing as it gets kind of experience. The lower level, has more interactive displays, short films, and curations about slave trade, the fight for black freedom, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, the black panthers, Barack Obama etc. There's a photography exhibit called Reflections. I wasn't sure what the purpose was... but I guess the photographer is African American... the subjects of the work are African Americans. Overall, I'd say the museum needs a bit more, esp the entrance level, the experience came to an end too quickly. I understand why it may be hard to achieve a more in depth curation/collection, because african american history simply wasn't as well documented as other histories. They could also do a better job in blocking off their temporarily closed areas... it looked a bit disorganised, but tolerable. It's not a must do, however if you're looking for something unique and enlightening to do, or if you like history, and open to knowing more about african american history - this is for you. I think it's 10 or 15 dollars for adult entry fee, I don't remember.

Museum Hack offers a tour of some of the most famous art museums, and we had occasion to visit their recent expansion to Chicago (they have been in New York and other cities for a few years). Why the ""Hack"" in their title? The tour is led by an improv or comedy wizard, which means that it was more fun, interactive and sometimes can offer a few 'cheeky' details about the painting or the artist. We laughed, we participated,and we collaborated with the other members of the tour as we went through the museum to focus on the pieces our guide had selected. The tour was two hours long, but did not feel anything close to that. I have a few new favorite pieces of art now, so even with the ""Hack"" they do significant homage to the art and the artists. I don't know how our tour guide researched all the facts about the paintings and art that we focused on, but it was truly fascinating to hear the history or backstory.

If you're only in town for a few days, the Smart probably doesn't need to make your itinerary, but if you're on campus or otherwise in or around Hyde Park (maybe at the Museum of Science and Industry, the Robie House, the Du Sable Museum, or the Oriental Institute), it's worth wandering over for an hour or two to look at the art or just to sit in the coffee shop in the lobby. The Smart has a very varied collection and not a huge amount of space to show it in. This means you will be in a room with American Modernist painters from Arthur Dove to Mark Rothko, then walk through a door and suddenly be standing before a case of ancient Chinese bronzes. I happen to like this, but some might find it a little offputting. A bigger issue is that a third or more of the museum is devoted to the central space for rotating special exhibitions, and several of the smaller galleries also have rotating shows. If you don't like the special exhibitions or if they are between shows then the Smart becomes a lot less interesting. If you're not already in Hyde Park it makes sense to see what's on before making the trip. One thing I like about the Smart is that there are usually several pieces up by artists with Chicago ties, often pieces by one or more of the Chicago Imagists. There will also usually be selections from the museum's large W.C. Westermann collection out on display. There's not a lot of 1960s-1980s Chicago art on view in the city, so it's good that there is usually some out at the Smart. The lobby of the museum is devoted to a coffee shop that is one of the better places in the neighborhood to sit and chill, and probably the best place on campus to do so. There's a pleasant courtyard in front of the building with a few sculptures in it and some seating for when the weather is nice.

A big question is whether the van Dyke is an original or a copy...either way, a treasure to behold. The lower floor is for rotating exhibitions. Presently, the thought provoking Utermohlen: A Persistence of Memory is a display of an artist witnessing his own decline to Alzheimer's disease. His humor, bold color and busy background designs has a Pop Art flair-the decline is obvious as time changes his statement. The William Castellana: South Williamsburg exhibition of black and white photos acquaints one with the Hassidic Jewish community in Brooklyn. It contrasts the orthodox life against modern life.

Street parking so allow half an hour to go through it. This is NOT where the 58,307 dog tags are.

This is a must visit for anyone who has served our country or respects those who do - aka everyone. It was so interesting reading the different stories of those who have served and even died for our freedom. I would recommend planning at least 1-2 hours when visiting and of course donating since the museum is free of charge. Also- We stopped here on our 1st trip to Chicago and had trouble finding it at first. There is a big sign overhead but walking on the sidewalk we passed it 3 times. Look for the 2 green bushes and then it's 2nd floor once you come inside. Add it on next time you're in the Windy City!,Couples,8,Ohio,Dance,Troy,F,Yes,01/15,Great and Eye-Opening Experience

And the answer is simple, yes, it is in Chicago. So, if you like us have been living here for a few years, and have just recently found out about it, it is O.K. because it is really tiny. It does not even look like a museum in contemporary understanding. It is located in the west loop, and looks just like any regular 3 story building. It has a sign on the door, please ring a bell, and please do, because the door is closed. All the yelp reviews about it are true. There is a little old lady at the door meeting you, and you can’t help but wonder about her age. Despite that, the lady is very lively and talkative, and seems happy to see you. Probably because you are her only customer at this time. The whole museum has 4 rooms, filled with holographic pictures. And they are amazing. This whole museum has such a character, and a very interesting feel about it. There is a cat that is following you from room to room, and seems just as interested in you as the owner upfront. After a brief introductory speech, you are free to wonder around the museum. You can spend as much time as you need to gaze at holograms. Some of them caught our attention more than others, but overall we had a great time. But the best part awaits for you at the end. The lady placed a few round pieces of plastic on her table, that looked like they were colored. But, according to her, they are plain. And then she starts spinning them, and makes you put some 3-D glasses on. The moment they are on, your life changes forever. Not only the pieces of plastic start reflecting colors, but those spinning patterns come right at you, and shine all colors of the rainbow. And then you start looking around, at your hands, at ceiling lights. It looks so different, your fingers become twice as long, and you see 3 hands instead of one. At this moment you realize how limited human eyes are and how many opportunities are there in our life for Holography. And you start wishing, that holography will be used in your lifetime, because it is just simply said – AMAZING. If you have a chance, just go there. And if it closed, oh well, come back. And it takes the lady 20 minutes to open the door – just be patient, after all she is 80+ years old. But once you are, enjoy. It is absolutely lovely!",Couples,44,IL,Dance,Chicago,F,No,03/10,Museum of Holography
