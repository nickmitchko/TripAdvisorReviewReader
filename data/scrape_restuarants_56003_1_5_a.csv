In route, we used trip advisor to read the reviews and view directions. Online business hours were written as 11:00am - 9:00pm on Sunday. We arrived at approximately 1:45pm and decided to sit at the sushi bar. We were greeted by our waitress. We decided to order a bottle of wine and start with appetizers. We informed our waitress we'd be enjoying many items on the menu to which she replied ""No problem."" After our appetizers arrived, we asked for a few moments to select an entree. Our waitress came back and asked in a strong tone ""Are y'all going to order anything else?"" At this point I thought maybe she's supposed to be off now. I responded, ""Is it time for you to be off?"" She told us yes it was. I asked if she could transfer us to another table so we could order without causing her to stay late to which she replied ""Sure."" Two minutes later, she came back and informed us we would have to leave because guests aren't allowed to eat after 3pm because the chef takes a break. I asked to speak with a manager. He came over and stated yes we would have to leave. Keep in mind we had and entire bottle of wine we had not consumed. I then explained we were first time guests and we were not aware guests couldn't eat or would be refused service at 3pm sharp. I also informed him #TripAdvisor shows hours of operation from 11AM - 9PM, to which he replied ""That doesn't matter."" We paid our tab of $58.22 and left a tip to make a point!

I should have reviewed Grotto a million times over, but I guess I eat here so often that I don't take the time to review. So, here is the 20 year overdue review. Grotto is awesome. We probably eat here once/week, and know most of the waiters by name. Grotto is a place where you can enjoy consistently fabulous food at lunch, dinner, brunch, anytime and always get a great meal. It's hard to review because everything we eat here is delicious. It's hard to go wrong when you could make a meal off the bread basket. Never ending bread is a gluten feast you don't want to miss. At lunchtime, we usually get the Business lunch special. It's a great value and more food than you could hope to eat. Get the Grotto salad, but try it with the Gorgonzola dressing. That's my favorite salad there. The pastas, fish, chicken, soups, appetizers, it's all always great. I love the Chicken Scallopini, and I've never had a bad fish dish here. Chicken and spinach canneloni (what I had today) is always decadent and fabulous. Also, drink the apricot tea. It goes with everything - especially at lunch when wine is not an option for those going back to work. Don't miss the chocolate cake. I bake, and my chocolate cake is fabulous. That makes it really hard to eat chocolate cake anywhere else. This is the one I'll make an exception for, and the yummy business lunch now includes a junior version of it! Happy day! The patio is also great this time of year. I love the olive trees and right now, when it's 70's in Houston, you can't beat them for a great outdoor dining adventure. The service is always consistently excellent. Attentive, friendly and never obtrusive. Most of the waiters have worked here for many, many years, and that shows the great management team at Grotto as well. If you time it right, you'll probably be sitting next to Tilman Fertitta as well - he dines here regularly. Thanks Grotto, for 20+ years of great dining.
