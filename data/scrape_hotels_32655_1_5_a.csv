Travelling family of 4 (2 boys age 9 & 14). We booked interconnecting rooms and the only downside of the stay was on the first night at check-in the desk made no mention that they did not actually have interconnecting rooms for us and our rooms were a few rooms apart. When I called and asked what had happened it was explained to me that I had booked adjacent/adjoining and this did not mean connecting rooms. I looked at my booking and email trail and it was absolutely clear to me that I had booked connecting rooms. They did fix it and that was greatly appreciated. But they had a real crack at blowing me off when I sought to check which makes you feel quite uncomfortable. Rest of the time the service at the hotel was excellent.

A couple of months ago, I returned to the Pink Palace, this time to try the recently refurbished rooms of the main building. Since 2012 through the end of 2014, the hotel had been subject to restoration in order to update its appearance and features, and of course ultimately offer a better guest experience. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is the service and the staff attention to the guests' comfort and needs... Everyone used to Dorchester Collection hotels will tell you that ! The least I can say is, and without much surprise, that it’s a tremendous success. Although I had not previously stayed at the hotel’s main building, it was quite obvious to note the multiple cutting-edge technology features (ah, those illuminated mirrors with built-in televisions…) and sophisticated new palettes… All while feeling the timeless, classical Hollywood glamour atmosphere of the property as if I was a golden age movie star :) In my room, the hotel’s signature pink and green colors were higlighted with materials such as soft leather and rich mohair in shades of cream and taupe. It also felt exceptionally cosy, needless to say. Besides the walnut, ebonized oak, and parchment lacquered furniture added depth to the ambience – especially when accentuated with the custom, antique bronze lighting fixtures lights… Sophisticated new features and amenities include B&O TVs with integrated technology and illuminated mirrors with built-in televisions, as previously mentioned... The thoughtfully-crafted restoration that I was able to observe hones and honors the original patina of The Beverly Hills Hotel, restoring and polishing its iconic design elements.

Stayed here based on various forum recommendations esp from other Aussies and wasn't disappointed.

Heaps of storage space, room safe, aircon, good bathroom, kitchenette with utensils, refrigerator, stove top but no microwave and good free wifi. I was in a room down the back and the view was the wall of the adjacent building, not a problem just an observation. I had a rental car for 2 of the 3 nights I was there and there is paid underground security parking with a lift up to the rooms. It's more of an apartment building than a motel or hotel and gives off a good vibe. All the staff I had dealings with were really professional and also very nice. I didn't partake in the breakfasts they offered - just grabbed a banana on my way out. There are washing machines and dryers in the basement area which take quarters. I also noticed a PC and printer for use by guests too. There's a pool also. One thing to note, if you have a rental car, be aware that Franklin Avenue which is the road you have to come along to get to the Orchid is pretty well gridlocked in peak am and pm times - well it was when I was there.

It was explained that we had been upgraded so that we would have a room that was ready since it was not check-in time as of yet. We appreciated this so much after a long flight. There was a queen size bed in each bedroom, along with a separate living room/kitchen. Each bedroom had a TV and a bathroom, and the living room also had a separate TV. The kitchen was a full size which would be very helpful under other circumstances. However, we were only staying overnight with an early flight the next morning. There was a fast food restaurant right around the corner which served us very well. The hotel does have evening food available on Monday-Wednesday I believe.

I find it very interesting that we were placed in the exact same room on the 10th floor. With 12 floors and it being the week of Christmas I find that for that to be a coincidence defies statistical odds, but that is another subject. The stay was nice, but when I turned up the heat to 76 degrees in the room, only cold air came from the vent. That certainly would not warm up the room. We called down and they sent up maintenance. He found that the level of some fluid was down to 80 something and it should have been up to 110 or so. He filled up the level, but it blew warmer air for sometime after he left, but not for long. Then we were back to the same. Since I called down for a blanket, I just left that issue alone. Yes, I needed some heat at night in LA over the Christmas 2016 holiday. But other than that, the room was the size that we like with a sofa, refrigerator, kitchenette, microwave, and sink. I do like that even for Christmas there was not a roudy night or any noise. And when we first arrived, you could hear voices from the next room, but once inside you could not, so that is a definite plus. They do have free breakfast, but there was not a good selection on Saturday morning and it was crowded so we went to the Original Pancake House. That was much better. They have a selection of foods that you can microwave (which is helpful late at night), but no restaurant on site. Overall it was a nice stay. We stayed a week and felt that they should have kept the Friday night at the same rate since we spending more than $1100 to stay there (a mere difference of less than $40). While a night is a night and they don't care who pays the higher rate (us or another guest) the fact that we had stayed a week should have made them think of the value of customer service and not that the less than $40 would trump the ability for us to have a great customer service experience, especially in light of the heat vent issue. It was nice, but I will choose another hotel on the strip because of that issue. There is too much competition for any hotel not to consistently deliver high customer satisfaction results. It does impact the bottom line, which most companies still don't see. So that $40 probably cost them more than several thousand as I will stay at another hotel on my next two visits. Oh, parking is $24, which is steep. Next time I will opt for free parking and not free breakfast since the free breakfast offerings are slim ad I have been to a hotel with free breakfast on several occasions that had a huge selection and prepared well.",Couples,4,Ohio,Dance,Cincinnati,NA,No,05/15,SELECTED AGAIN!!

Or a 4-star hotel catering to their guest’s needs? Unfortunately for us, it couldn’t and shouldn’t try to be both. This hurt what could have been an smooth stay and an easy recommendation. My wife and I chose The Rebury because it was in walking distance (no easy feat) to the Metro, coffee shops, and a Trader Joe’s. The latter was great because it meant we could utilize the large kitchenette in our room. Weeks prior, we politely requested a suite away from any avoidable noise. We’re well-traveled and fine with city din and keenly aware that we were near the famous or infamous Hollywood and Vine, so we were given a room that faced the street – and sadly, the Avalon nightclub next door. Needless to say, being in close proximity to a nightclub meant we heard the crowd, the drums, and the DJ until late. Even with being out late ourselves. Another room was offered the next day. This time facing inward to their courtyard where we knew the Redbury’s own The Library was situated. An indoor/outdoor lounge we were assured would either be not open because of weather (true for the Friday we were there) or not open late. Well, at 1:40am on Saturday, the music was still going, so we called to complain. The sheepish desk help said it would be over soon. Not good enough. We lost sleep and our tempers. The courtyard worked as an echo chamber pushing the music up to us at nearly full-volume. Funnily enough, we actually liked the playlist, but wanted to hear it on our terms especially when paying a nightly fee. We received an apology and an acknowledgement that noise is a constant complaint. No shock there. And they had no answer as to how sound-proofing the door, but not the windows made any sense. In the end, no discount, rebate or comp was offered from the front desk for the inconveniences. It’s a real shame because the rooms (with balconies) are very clean and spacious. The kitchenette is complete with gas burners, a fridge, a microwave and utensils. The location was perfect. At least for us. The suite was quite quiet when the lounge was closed. And the staff were warm, albeit not very helpful in the end. We were told that the hotel is closing in July and may reopen without the bar downstairs. That’s good.

We like to stay here overnight when going to Beverly Hills for an evening out. This time, we opted to upgrade to a Junior Suite with a city view and balcony since we were celebrating a belated Valentines Day. Bad choice. Our Junior Suite cost an additional $100 per night. There was no city view; only a view of the apartment buildings across the street. The buildings obstructed the city view into LA. The room was in dire need of a refurbishing. The upholstery on the furniture was worn, dirty and smelled bad. The carpeting was old, stained, and tattered. The balcony was dirty with a rusted bistro table and two chairs, one lounge and very old and stained cushions. The entire balcony hadn't been cleaned or swept in quite some time. The bathroom needed an upgrade and a rebath. There was a soaking jaccuzi tub with a shower head on the wall; a very strange combination. I imagine that it would have been slippery and dangerous to take a shower. Fortunately, the hotel was not sold out and we were able to switch to a Standard King room. We were quite pleased with the change in rooms, and had a very nice stay.

However, this stay (Sept 28-Oct 2) was not quite up to my expectations. The room I booked was to be a king bed room but I was given a two double bed room that was relatively small compared to those I have had for past stays. I didn't complain but should have. The room was on the Olympic Blvd side of the hotel and was very noisy especially during rush hours. It was OK noise wise at night and I slept OK. The room has a small refrigerator that was only sort of cool when I arrived so I adjusted the temperature control to a cooler setting (adjustment knob on the back of the frig) and it was cold for a while but then went back to being only slightly cool. Since the hotel doesn't offer breakfast my wife and I generally eat a quick breakfast in the room and the frig didn't keep our milk cold at all. During our stay the elevator was either broken or working only very slowly and we ended up taking the stairs up to the third floor most of the time. The fitness room consists of two treadmills and an elliptical machine, some dumbell weights and an exercise bench. I believe it also had a recumbent bike machine. The treadmills and elliptical worked great but the ceiling fans weren't sufficient to keep the room air fresh in the late afternoon. The open air fitness room was pleasant first thing in the morning. The location remains a plus for me since my son lives about 0.7 miles away. Santa Monica, downtown LA, Beverly Hills and many other attractions are close by. Fox Studios is right around the corner. There is a 9 hole golf course not far away and a lovely LA park with a walking/running trail around the perimeter.

We did the paperwork and received our warm chocolate cookies and went to our room. We also had free wifi due to HHHonors membership. I highly recommend HH Honors and booking direct.

However, they do provide complimentary shuttle service to where you need to go subject to their requirements, so Ozzy was happy to drive us to the supermarket to collect a few snacks and wine for our cruise. We had room service one night and the food was good, we also ate in the restaurant on the Friday night and enjoyed the happy hour as well as outstanding entertainment by Musician Charlie who plays every Friday night.

The beds were very comfortable, although the first bed I had was slightly elevated in the middle due to wear (I stayed in 3 rooms during my 7-day stay). There also were some small discrepancies in the stocking of amenities from suite to suite (e.g. no bath salts in one suite, which I wouldn't have known was a standard amenity if they hadn't been supplied in another suite). The exercise facilities could use some upgrading. For example, they only have one upright cycle, which was out of order one day. I had a good massage at the spa. Wifi is excellent and included in the room price. Newspapers are well-stocked at the concierge desk. The nightclub is lively (there is a drag show every Thursday) and looked fun. I never went to it, but you pass by on the way back from the restaurant. The location is central, but not very scenic.

We had to hang a towel over it to ensure the cars and pedestrians outside couldn't see in. Also, the bathroom door in our room was basically a thin closet door that didn't even completely obscure viewing, let alone block sound.

We went back down to reception to complain about the issue and they offered us a different room, which we took up. (Room 2) We had a dinner reservation for 8pm, so we were in a rush to swap rooms, we put our luggage and had a quick look around. Unbelievably, this room was also not clean! When we went down to catch our Uber for dinner, we spoke to the manager and asked him to have the room cleaned before our return from dinner, he apologised and gave us free parking for the two nights we were staying. When we got back we checked the room, as we were now sceptical about their cleaning abilities we checked the room further and it only got worse. The shower still had hairs in it, and we found a hair in the bed sheets along with stains on the pillow case. Another call to reception, who told us the manager had now gone for the evening. (9.40pm) They offered us a third room which we took, however it took until 10pm to get us to this room. (Room 3) This room had beach views (so was an upgrade on our first two car park view rooms). I'm pleased we hadn't paid a premium for it as the view was limited and you actually had all the road noise being on the front of the property. This room had been double checked before we got into it, and alas we had a clean room! Great. The young chap who helped us changed rooms was very polite and helpful. The next morning, we discovered that the window lock did not work in this room which we reported to reception and they had fixed while we were out that day. All three of the rooms we experienced were on the small side, we have stayed at 6 different hotels during our holiday (road trip) and these have been the smallest rooms by a large margin. The bathrooms, have poor water pressure and the ventilation is inadequate to deal with the steam of showering. The provided toiletries, were of a good standard. Also in all three bathrooms the toilet roll holder was loosely fitted to the wall, I suspect they need to upgrade these to a better standard of fitting. The furniture in the bedrooms is of good quality and the bed was comfy. Nice lighting and a good quality tv. There is a well stocked mini bar, which of course is hideously expensive. Half the hotels we have stayed at have provided free bottled water, which I think could easily be provided given the large price tag on these rooms. The location of this hotel is good, close to the pier, shopping and restaurants. The price of this hotel is not acceptable considering the experience we had.

The bathroom has 0 sound proofing as there is a sliding glass door and a sliding glade window to look into the room. Needless to say all noises heard in the bathroom. The room was very European and not that large. The bed is in the middle of the room with a desk behind it. There is no true lobby to hang out as there is a restaurant when you walk in and the only sitting area is outside the entrance. Platinum members get a free breakfast which is a $58 value for 2 people. Great little buffet breakfast which was very good. Very good service. They ran out of Nova the first day and they brought me pancakes instead. We also went to the main restaurant for dessert the second nIght. The bar scene was vibrant but service was missing. After my wife complained several times the manager moved us to a table in the desser area and bought our dessert which was very good. $42 a day for valet plus tax. Fitness center was nice and had working cardio machines. Pool table I believe on every floor of the hotel.,Couples,1,Florida,Dance,Boca Raton,M,Yes,07/11,The Staff Put This Rating 4 Stars

We had a good breakfast at the outside restaurant and the food was good. $50.00 for breakfast for 2 adults.

Now there are very few suites and although the room size is good there are no drawers to store clothes! We had hotel remove all the pricey snacks and drinks off shelves so we could put clothes somewhere. Maybe they do not expect guests to stay for 5 days as we did and just assume a guest is fine living out of suitcase for a day or two. We have stayed here about 12 times and will never return.

The do not offer a shower cap, cotton swabs or nail file. The bathroom was very small with no room to set anything. The wallpaper is dated and worn. There was a big crack in our tile floor and the sink has obviously been repaired with no care for looks. 2 out of the 4 nights we were there they had private parties so the bar was not available. One night the pool bar was open but you have to drink out of plastic. I had heard good things about ""The W"" brand, I was truly disappointed. The staff made the place enjoyable.

I felt the service was secondary to the arrogance of W employees who were just so over it after 2.5 terrible stays years and years ago. This W was my last great time with a W but that was years ago, but still one of my fave stays (W/Moscone also a top rate). So, I had some PTO time that needed burning and off the W did I go while hanging with some WeHo pals. Before I arrived I was in contact with an SPG employee who already started putting meat ease that maybe customer service was back at W Hotels. Front desk was extra friendly without being condescending, that's appreciated especially when traveling to hip hotels. Anyway, no matter what I needed, FOH and BOH was more than gracious. I cannot say enough about the guest experience. It had been a long time but it's pretty obvious SPG has re-upped their guest experience game. That said, the place still is cool. The lobby lighting design is impressive but not overwhelming. Super cool bulbs in the mid-lobby enclave feels stylish but doesn't try too hard for the cool factor. My suite was comfortable, had just enough mid-century to not feel trendy, but I really loved the translucent mermaid wall art. One of my fave snaps on my Insta. If you're looking for a cool LA vibe without being stuck at way overpriced Sunset hot spots, this W is great. Close to the freeway, a pretty drive into Hollywood, the location is far removed from the malarkey on Sunset. STK is fun. Service was seamless but a bit impersonal but noting to worry about. Look, it's LA, there's far worse egos from servers elsewhere. Look for Jamal the bartender in the lobby bar. Solid cat, no ego, always friendly.",Solo,5,Florida,Dance,Southwest Gulf Coast,M,No,01/14,"Visiting pals, chillin' solo the W way."

Actually, it's probably the best W I have ever stayed in (and I've been to a few across the globe). The service was great, the front desk person actually insisted to come out of the hotel to check whether I'd parked in an allowed zone (I did not, so she probably saved me some serious $$$). As a Platinum member, I've got upgraded to an enormous Mega suite. Why not 5 stars, then, you might ask. Well, I just don't like the so-called ""hip"" concept of this chain, which also then draws a certain crowd. So maybe it's not fair (I chose to stay there knowing in advance what to expect ), but it is what it is. The location is great, just off of the Westwood Village, although it is really annoying that they call it ""West Beverly Hills"", which is an inaccurate marketing gimmick for a typical denizen of W's. Absolutely superb if one is visiting UCLA (2min walk), but the village itself is a nice touristy spot with restaurants and shops. From there, the (in)famous 405 freeway can take you anywhere (10-15min to the ocean, Santa Monica, Venice Beach, or hop over to the San Fernando Valley, and even the Downtown is not too far). Not to mention that LAX is less than 30min away. All these times should be taken with a grain of salt - LA traffic can be horrible. My favorite ride though is to drive along the Sunset Blvd - from this location enter at the ultra posh Bel Air, then go East through Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Hollywood, all the way to Chinatown and Downtown, or with more time go West all the way to Malibu and the back before taking the above-mentioned East route. This could easily be a whole day, or more, if you visit places along the way (Getty Museum, shop in Bev. Hills, etc.).",Solo,29,New York,Dance,New York City,NA,No,08/15,"Perfect Service, Great Location"
