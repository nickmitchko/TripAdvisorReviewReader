That said people were very nice, rooms clean, we had a suite on one of the higher floors, everything worked (except somehow always the Bluetooth connection on the hifi).. In all we were very happy at a reasonable price. We very much liked the concierge service in advance of our stay. THey helped us swiftly and effectively find locations for entertainment and late dining, in a way we very much appreciated. GpH is of course ideally located in the middle of Manhattan with virtually everything at walking or biking (must do: ride a bike down Lexington!) distance. Even with the hot weather we walked almost everywhere and where amazed at how easy this was. We did not use much of the hotels facilities other than our room.

Most recently, I stayed here for a full 4 weeks because I wanted to live in a quiet but cultural area, which felt homely but not so “hotel” like. I can assure anybody that the GPH is all of these things and much more. If you decide to stay here and let me tell you that you would be daft NOT to, you would surely be very well attended-to. The hotel management are highly competent and fulfil your every bespoke requirements. You will also find yourself in the beautiful, quiet and relaxed neighbourhood that is Gramercy, where there are numerous, good restaurants and cafes nearby - Irving place is a good place to check out and only a few blocks ascending Lexington Ave, if you’re partial to some “spice in your life”, you'll find a hub of Indian Restaurants also known as ""Curry Hill”. The hotel is in the best of locations and is in close-proximity to more or less, everywhere you would want to go. Yes, it is also most ideal for the type of folks who wish to find a retreat away from the constant electricity of the city BUT even more important is the actual fact, that the GPH is a special place because it is unassuming, relaxed, extremely genuine and unpretentious, while it makes you feel as if it is exclusively for you! In addition to all these positives, I also guarantee that you will find NO other place that is as aromatic as the GPH! The woody scent shall linger in your nasal cells forever (or until you re-vist at least. Le Labo Cade 26 candles infuse every layer of the building, from the lower ground floor, through to the running machines in the gym, diffusing upwards towards the ceiling of your hotel suite! The GPH radiates a divinity that will force to question yourself whether to leave the hotel or not. An utterly genteel experience was had during the month that I stayed here. This is not only because of its given sophisticated charm and the great gallery of full fledged works of art that it houses but more significantly because the hotel is actually represented by some very fine, engaging and supporting members of staff who are willing to look and listen to you - this is what was distinctive. Upon entering/exiting the main door, you cannot miss being greeted and helped with the big, welcoming and friendly smile who is known as “Carlos”. He is particularly brilliant and considerate (as well as charming) and will offer you his assistance at all times. In addition, the Front Desk team, including “Sam"", “James"", “Fady"", “Amber"" and “Betty"" were highly attentive and accommodated me in my every request. The A lady named “Alana” from Room Service was particularly helpful too, as was the very kind Housekeeper, “Valselka”. The Concierge associates “Joy” and “Bernardo” were also informative in regards to shortcuts around the city.

The staff were all terrific -- friendly, informative and kind. Some of them were there long before the current owners but I know they wouldn't still be around if they weren't the absolute best! Owner Susan is relatively new to the business but she was definitely born to be a hotelier. It's not possible to say enough good things about her so I'll demonstrate. My stay didn't start out well. Though I had read on their website that they don't have an elevator I was under the impression that their buildings were two-stories tall. They are four-stories and I was originally booked on the top floor. I explained that there was no way I could possibly negotiate four flights of stairs because of an acute exacerbation of a back condition and because of really bad knees! The desk clerk was able to move me to the second floor, which was fine. Unfortunately I had an awful first night because of noise from a business in the building immediately adjacent to that room. I called the front desk to ask what was going on. It was about 2am and the woman who answered the phone was as chipper as if it were 10am! The noise abated for awhile but then came back. By that time I really too exhausted to talk so I just waited it out. Normally I would have demanded a refund for the remaining nights of the stay and moved to another place. But before I could do anything, Susan came over to see me the moment I dragged myself to the lobby for coffee. Her apologies were profuse and accompanied by an action plan: she would comp my room and have me moved to a quieter part of the hotel. As much as it pains me that she has had to bear the brunt of the thoughtless landlord and even more thoughtless tenant, both of whom cause her so much grief, I accepted her plan with gratitude. The breakfast was good though I would have liked more options that didn't contain sugar. For example, at the time of my visit they had lots of yogurts but they were all fruit flavored. On the plus side I had forgotten how much I love cottage cheese! In the evenings they offer not just wine but a variety of spirits as well. While I did appreciate the quieter second room, I have to be honest and say that I was a bit stunned to find that it didn't have a chair, while the first room had two. That was remedied when I purloined a side chair from the front house. It wasn't as comfortable as the nice upholstered wing-back but it was fine for my needs.

But I had to stay four nights, and everyone I knew was busy. The Lotte Palace was suggested because of its location near Rockefeller Center and the Rainbow Room, where the event I wanted to attend was being held. I was uneasy about navigating on my own, because I have virtually no sense of direction, but the staff essentially adopted me! I was too tired the day I arrived ti go out to dinner, and I ordered from room service. I was astonished when my dinner was delivered by Denzil, who went out of his way to set up a beautiful table for me, realized I was confused about the blinds, and saw to everything that was even slightly out of order. We chatted as he bustled around my room with great tact and courtesy, and it turns out that he commutes to New York from Belchertown, MA, where he lives with his wife and the youngest of his four children. He had managed to put all three of his older children through college, and I convinced him to have his brilliant young daughter apply to a school in MA, with which I'm affiliated. He refused to accept a tip from me, though he had gone far beyond being invaluable my enjoying my stay The next morning at breakfast the man I assumed was the maitre 'D, John, asked me about my evening, and I said that it had been a delight, but that I hadn't really enjoyed the wine from the mini-bar. He asked what sort of wine I preferred, and I replied that I enjoyed Prosecco, which is not available at The Lotte Palace. That afternoon a very charming man tapped on my door and presented me with a bottle of lovely Prosecco (Stella de Notte) iced, and sent complements of John. I was absolutely amazed and very grateful. Even the doormen worried over me--asking me to check in with them when I returned, since it was abundantly clear that I had no idea where I was going, and they wanted to be sure I had returned. The Palace is wonderful, spotlessly clean, very well decorated, and quite luxe, but the stars of the establishment are the staff! I wish I could remember them all--there's Jerry, who managed to transport all of my extra luggage, and my housecleaner, sho was tactful and so thorough that I was really surprised, and of course Denzil and John made this one of the most pleasant trips I've ever taken in my life!

The walls seem to be fairly thin however, as I could hear my neighbor's TV both at night and in the morning. Unfortunately, my stay was tainted by a massive mix-up at check-in: I booked a room at the last minute due to a late flight arrival. I work near the hotel and wanted to go straight to sleep so I could walk to work in the morning. I arrived around 11pm and there was a line of 5 people ahead of me at reception, which I found bizarre. The receptionist, who incidentally was not very friendly, sent me to the wrong room! At 11:15 at night! After trying my key card about 10 times, I went to the phone in the hallway to call the lobby. The operator said she would send security up to let me in. I went back to the room to try the key a few more times and, to my surprise, a man (whom I woke up trying to get in to his room) came to the door. It was extremely embarrassing and I apologized and showed him my key and where the receptionist wrote his room number as mine on the key envelope. At this point I had to go back down to the lobby, wait in line again, and explain the situation. The receptionist offered a terse apology, but nothing further. Unacceptable, but I was too exhausted to push the matter further. The Palace is clearly not up to par with other luxury hotels when it comes to service quality.

She was so pleasant and friendly and I felt relaxed and at home right away. Checking out was breeze too, Kevin checked me out and kindly stored my bags for me as I had a night flight. I was heading out site seeing during the day and didn't want to lug a suitcase around for the day. The decor in the hotel is lovely and quaint and all very clean, a little bit of French elegance in New York, very tasteful. The room itself was nicely decorated and again spotless. Towels and l'occitanne toiletries provided in the bathroom which were lush! The room and bathroom was finished to a high spec and the bed so comfy! It was like sleeping on a fluffy cloud. I didn't hear any noise from the outside at all as it's on a quiet street. Room is a decent size for NYC. Location is great! I walked everywhere, Times Square on your door stop as it the Port Authority Bus station so getting to and from JFK airport was a doddle. Also walking distance ( 20 mins ) are the high line and Central Park.

My stay wasn't cheap and so does any good hotels in NY, it's more than USD 600+ per night for at least half of my stay so I did have some expectations on them. I requested airport pick up weeks in advance and been told only a day or two prior to my arrival their driver contact info would be available so I emailed them again before my departure from hometown but didn't receive any reply. I was very anxious as the last thing I want after an 16 hrs long haul flight is to have your car pick up messed up. Thankfully the driver was there but the hotel never got back to me but instead just told me somehow my email went to their junk. I had a Bryant suite and it was quite large, spacious and as other people mentioned an IKEA feel minimal decor. My room was on 14/F and facing the park directly, it was quite noisy both because of the winter village going on there and also the traffic. Location wise is great, the closest subway station is just 3 mins walk, and blue bottle coffee is right next door. NY public library is across the street and theatre district is still within walking distance. Upon my arrival, the bell boy who took my luggage was rude, I noticed the same attitude from him throughout my stay there and it was really unacceptable that at one point he didn't even respond when I said good morning to him. Thought his name was Matt or sth, anyway he was as if so reluctant to show me the features in the room or to ask if I need any assistance. The only time he smiled at me was when I gave him the tip for helping me the luggage. For my whole stay, their staff expecially the operator addressed me as Mr. which made me so confused and yet annoyed. But then the worst experience was to have my winter socks gone missing from my room and the only response you got from the front desk was ""there's nothing we could do atm as the sheets gone to the laundry company already and they said nothing was found"" when I first reported the incident. They didn't offer anything upfront or tried to make you feel better. I never accused anyone of any wrongdoing as I always believed it was a genuine misplacement, but then their response was very disappointing. On my second last night of stay I found strands of hair in the walking shower upon their completion of housekeeping and turndown service, I understand the staff has very limited time to clean up the rooms but then for the rated I paid that was just not acceptable. Overall, the room is a bit worn out, you could see the hook is coming off, they put paint in the bathtub, dust on the switches. It wasn't a disaster but it might need a touch up or remake soon. I agree with other reviewers the lack of in room tea / coffee (even for suites) and their in room dining options are not really expansive but yet they charge steep. This seems a lengthy review but I think all travellers deserve their money well spent and it's important for us to share the first hand experience.",Solo,13,NA,Dance,,NA,Yes,04/16,First NY visit

In both rooms, the bathroom and room were very clean, with plenty of space to spread out, good closet space, footstools that doubled as a place to put luggage, a safe, plenty of outlets and USB ports to plug in, cool lighting that you could adjust in a million ways and the bed...oh, the bed, was so comfortable and the linens were wonderful and plenty of pillows. I liked the location off of the main avenues - easy to get to Penn Station, Times Square, Chelsea, the Highline, subway lines, etc. Would definitely stay here again, would just ask for NO adjoining room. Note that there are not a lot of rooms on each floor so there will also be a likelihood that you'll be within earshot of the elevators.

On 5th Avenue, over looking the iconic Central Park it is a truly journey down memory lane. I must start with the admission that I didn't use the restaurant nor did I order from room service so to that extent this review is incomplete. If the F&B review is an important part of your decision then you are better off looking at another review. I arrived mid-afternoon to a friendly & efficient front office team. Check in was smooth & I was lucky to be upgraded to one of their suites. That the suite didn't over look Central Park was a small price to pay for having the extra space. The suite was spacious & comfortable with ample cupboard space. As is customary in most American hotel rooms no kettle or coffee machine was provided here but that was quickly rectified with a call to house keeping who were more than happy to equip my suite with both a kettle & a coffee machine. Supplies for these were refreshed every morning without anyone having to be reminded. The suite is equipped with large screen televisions & the sitting room also has a home theatre system. The bedroom has a radio/iPod dock which doubles as an alarm clock as well. The cleanliness of the suite was of a very high standard with lovely crisp linen and super soft towels. Housekeeping were on the ball as far as the evening turn down service and morning clean up of the suite were concerned. They were quietly efficient some how always managing to get their work done in the intervals that I was away so they never once disturbed me by knocking to ask if I needed the suite serviced. The most charming part of the hotel & some thing I haven't seen in a hotel in years - lift operators. Every one of the lifts/elevators has an operator who greets you with a smile. By the end of the second day most, if not all of them, knew which floor I wanted to get off on and were always ready with a friendly greeting & a short chat about the weather or a good natured enquiry as to how my day was going. I used the gym a few times & although it wasn't the best equipped gym I've seen in a hotel it wasn't the worst either. Two treadmills, a couple of bikes and elliptical machines make up the cardio equipment. For strength training there is a set of dumbbells & a multigym pulley system which were more than adequate for a good workout. No shortage of water & towels plus headphones available on the counter. This close to Central Park it would be a travesty to run on a treadmill and I was lucky to have great weather which allowed me to do a 10K run around the Jackie Kennedy reservoir. If you are looking for a place with character & old world charm in the heart of uptown New York with a great neighbourhood you can't do much better than The Pierre.

For starters, it is extremely high priced - even by New York standards. And for the price, the hotel should offer a full 5-star experience; it falls short. The rooms are beautifully appointed but not quite practical. A lovely bottom lit crystal display holding night time cookies cannot be easily turned off. In fact, I could never find a switch or a plug anywhere and ended up having to cover the light with a pillow. The open shower looks awesome, but the soaps are on a table at one end of the large shower which causes you to have to go several feet to the open (and cool) part of the shower just to get what you need. The soaps, themselves are beautifully bottled and high quality, but are in squeeze bottles that are nearly impossible to squeeze (and I am a strong man). The windows cannot be claimed to be soundproof as the sound of this morning's garbage pick up felt like it was in my room. As did the noise of the large arguing family from across the hall from my room. As did the smell of smoke from that same family. The doormen were not always present and certainly offered no value in a rainstorm when they were out of umbrellas. The bar is beautiful and the staff is well meaning.

It was almost prohibitively expensive; I later came to my senses, canceled the booking and instead stayed 2 blocks north at my go-to midtown hotel, the Peninsula (still expensive, but not as prohibitively). I looked here again for this year's NYC trip and came upon a Complimentary Third Night offer that I couldn't refuse. Even without the offer, the room rates seemed slightly lower that last year--perhaps in the past year the hotel got a better understanding of what the market can bear seasonally. Mind you, it was by no means cheap, but definitely a better value. I believe the Baccarat building was built from the ground up on 53rd St. directly across the street from MOMA. The hotel occupies the first 12 floors, with private residences in a tower above it. The hotel was built by the Starwood Capital Group (which of course also owns the French Baccarat crystal company), run by a former CEO of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc. (St. Regis, Westin, W, Sheraton, etc.). Before its March 2015 opening, the hotel was bought by Beijing-based Sunshine Insurance Group, but I think is still managed by Starwood. Seemingly no expense was spared--opulence drips from the hotel's countless Baccarat chandeliers like water from a leaky faucet. The front of the Baccarat building has 3 identical entrances. The middle doors access the hotel, on either side are entrances to the residences and the closed-for-now restaurant (formerly called Chevalier). There are 3 chandeliers in the ground floor foyer, plus a fire feature and a large dynamic wall of light. The second floor houses the reception and concierge desks, plus the Grand Salon (for now the hotel's only restaurant) and the very French-looking Bar with an outdoor terrace. Needless to say, chandeliers abound. Below ground are the fancy Spa de La Mer (the famous skincare brand), the fitness centre (even it has a chandelier), and the elegant pool complete with cabana-like chaises. A room key is needed to access this level. Arrival went smoothly and professionally. The doorman took my name and whisked my luggage away. I proceeded to the 2nd floor reception desk. Exiting the elevator, staff at the Grand Salon and the concierge welcomed me before I even reached the front desk. It was late morning, the room was not quite ready, but became ready within about 15 minutes. The receptionist escorted me to the room (a key is needed to access guestroom floors) and introduced its features. The key, by the way, is a replica of an old-fashioned key with the red fob being the actual active electronic component. They'll let you keep one as a souvenir. The Baccarat has 3 basic room categories (aside from Suites)--Classic King, Grand Classic King and Grand Classic Double. I booked the ""lowliest"" Grand Classic, which was just fine, thank you. I had requested a higher floor and got the highest (12th). Outside each guestroom is a glass display case housing a Baccarat goblet the hotel commissioned an artist to turn into a unique piece of art, so the hallway is like a little French museum--very impressive! None of the Classic Kings face 53rd St., they all face south. My room was high enough so that it got a great deal of natural light from between buildings that front 52nd St. The attention to detail that went into the room's design, the quality of materials used and how the rooms were specifically maintained became immediately apparent. The heaviness of the doors, the TV concealed in a large mirror, the Laduree sweet treats in the minibar (not free), the pull-out refrigerated minibar (where non-alcoholic beverages were free), the red lacquered Baccarat box that opens up to reveal Baccarat glassware of all shapes and sizes, the Baccarat glassware in the bathroom (I was so afraid I'd break one brushing my teeth!), the large sized bath amenities, the linen-look slippers and laundry/shoe bags, the wall-mounted bulletin board with ribbons that substitutes as a desk drawer, the large table (complete with a plaster bust and book about Baccarat) that serves as a desk as well as dining area, the French macarons (Laduree?) left under a goblet as a turndown treat, the bedsheets subtly imprinted with chandeliers, the little Baccarat sticker left on the roll of toilet paper whenever housekeeping entered--all these things were noticed. And of course, there was a Baccarat mini-chandelier, as well as crystal jars atop an under-lit marble bench that were in fact light fixtures. What looks like a large red book on the nightstand actually houses the mini-tablet (about the size of an IPhone 6) that does controls everything in the room and can contact anyone in the hotel. Small niggles: the tablet malfunctioned--I was not able to use it as a phone. The engineer couldn't fix it, nor could IT, but it was fixed by the next day. The huge marble shower's knobs were unmarked, so it took some maneuvering to figure out what knob did what. I was never able to get really hot water from the huge overhead rainhead, but could from the hand-held head. The towels were Baccarat branded and came in 4 sizes (bath sheet, bath towel, hand and face), but were surprisingly thin and non-fluffy. The TV was not terribly responsive (if you changed channels quickly, it would say ""no signal""), and the channel guide was inexplicably inaccessible from the remote. There was only one trash can by the WC. Although I had hoped to have breakfast one day in the Grand Salon, that never happened. I did look at the menu--it was identical in price (pricey) and selection (smallish) to the room-service menu. Nor did I try the popular bar. I also had hoped to try Chevalier, but it closed (and was taken off the website) shortly before my stay. I remember before opening last year the great fanfare there was for Chevalier, how an alum of La Grenouille (Charles Masson) was helping in its development, and a well-regarded chef (Shea Gallante) was in the kitchen. I wonder what happened, and happened so quickly. Apparently, the space will reopen in the future with a remodel and ""new concept"". In the meantime, for a nearby famous meal, head half a block west and stand in line at either of the Halal Guys carts on 53rd and 6th Ave., which I did on more than one occasion. I didn't eat there on the street like so many do; I took my chicken with rice ($7) and my falafel sandwich ($5) back to my luxurious Baccarat Hotel room and ate it there coupled with a glass-bottled soda and glass-bottled Evian water from the minibar--both free and both poured into Baccarat crystal glasses.

Plenty of local restaurants but be careful we found quality of food poor. There is a great Italian round in Mott st called Pepe rosa - simple but well done Italian. Other Italians were commercial and fair to middling. Always beware of spruikers out the front my Italian Nona told me. Means poor food. Generally she has been right. Hotel staff we found good and helpful but , depending who is on, some of them ok some very very helpful. But that's a small criticism. In retrospect the small room was probably too small for a stay of this length and our other hotels inNY had larger rooms. But the room had a great shower and separate toilet , good bed, and a desk and some hanging space . Just not a lot of room to do anything else. One thing I believe the staff should have better awareness of the best local food and offer more information on attractions etc. We found great restaurant tips from the guy in the liquor store next door. The worst thing with the hotel was the wifi which kept blocking all sorts of sites including our newspaper ap which was damn annoying. ...plus continually needing to log in even if you didn't leave the room. Over time we found that tiring and annoying and would want that sorted before staying again. It seems a common theme in our USA hotels however . Poor wifi with lots of constraints and polices to make you use the wifi less. Go figure ! Anyway we certainly enjoyed our stay here apart from the twentieth century wifi thingy. Would we return? Probably not but that's as much wanting to stay in another area as much as wanting a different hotel experience. Btw don't go to the supposed malaysian restaurant across the road.

You can normally tell if people are either acting or forcing themselves to be polite. Every staff I interacted with had that genuine look, they were more than happy to help me with any item, big or small. Smartly dressed as well. My room on the fifth floor, 525, was a deluxe room which meant more space than the standard room. The first thing you see as you open the door is the kitchen area. Lots of everything is here, cupboards, utensils, oven, microwave, dishwasher and a fridge/freezer. Only thing missing was a washer/dryer. Loads of storage for clothes and luggage. There is a safe in the room that's easy to use. The bed was massive, a king size bed which I got lost in. The bed was a bit too firm for my liking, but no problems sleeping. The tv also was a big size with a lot of channels. After the Q&A app is downloaded to your phone it shows you how many channels are available to view. Some are on demand and cost extra to watch but there are lot. The bathroom is well lit with a bath/shower, which gives you a choice of 2 shower heads. One is fixed above your head and the other is movable.The air conditioner came in handy during my stay, which was hot. The control panel is part of the unit, I had to ask at the desk, on the right and lift up a panel to see the controller. This was my first hotel downtown and because the streets are a lot narrower than the rest of Manhattan the views of the next building are closer, so my view was of an empty building. The hotel is less than two minutes away from the subway system. The entrance to the 2/3 trains is across the street maybe 100 yards away. No shortage of food options around the area.

I complained to the front desk and they called the housekeeping for turndown service in front of me. I had to go outside again and came back around 4:30pm. Surprisingly no turndown service!!!! What is wrong with the service?? I was 3months pregnant and it was boiling outside and I was really feeling sick. I was lucky that I didn't faint. I went to the front desk and there was new staff and had to explain all over again. It was very disappointing and upsetting. I had to go outside another 1 hour AGAIN, and finally entered my room.

Upon entering I was greeted warmly by the friendly and stylish staff. I arrived before check-in time, so I set up shop in the cafe. I love that there are 3 different vibes to choose from in the lobby - inside the bar, outside in the spacious atrium, or the cafe, which is home to the best coffee in town (Jack's Stir Brew). I came back down later in the evening, joined some friends at the Roxy Bar and then we went down to The Django, a subterranean gem that transports you to the golden era of NYC. The in-house jazz band was incredible, which then transitioned to a DJ late night who was playing the most eclectic mix of rock, funk, soul, and forgotten guilty pleasures. It was so refreshing not to hear the same mainstream nonsense played everywhere else. And the crowd was an equally diverse mix of beautiful people. My room was surprisingly spacious and the design was subtle and chic. I'm very particular on lighting, so I really appreciated that all the lights were on dimmers. It's this attention to detail that pervades throughout the hotel. If you're an out-of-towner and want to feel like a New Yorker, I can't imagine a better property than this one.

They were always there to greet me with a smile and story to start my day with a chuckle! I also enjoyed my solo visits to Winnie's b/c Kerri and Lindsey are attentive to everyone! Additionally, I would have to say the musicians and singers at Winnie's are an excellent sampling of the outstanding talent in NYC (with the exception of Saturday evening, which I found sub-par as far as the singer went). Also, finally sampled Parker & Quinn, and looked on in amazement as Kristen handled the packed bar alone, without ever missing a beat! The stellar staff at the Refinery is unbeatable. And, did I mention the accommodations? Well, my stays both times were truly top-notch. I love the space that even the smallest rooms afford, compared to my experiences at other hotels. In addition, love the touches that harken back to the hotel's days as a sewing factory.

There was some confusion on checking in which delayed getting into the room for several hours.

Partly due to location (no busy streets) and partly by design, you'll find it very easy to sleep here. The climate control is also excellent. The service is fantastic. Every staff person I interacted with was amazing. They had taken my favorite breakfast (lemon ricotta pancakes to die for) off the menu, so they comped my breakfast and the chef made me some regular pancakes, which were also great, the difference being that making good pancakes is not a heavy lift whereas light-as-a-feather ricotta pancakes are. You are also in a great location. While they have a fine indoor fitness facility, you are a stone's throw from one of the country's premier stretches of riverfront for a nice jog.

First impressions were great. The concierge surprised us by giving us ""Platinum for a day"" guest status, which meant free breakfast in practice. Although we were still given a standard room, it was on the top floor, which is considered an upgrade of sorts, although I already have Gold status anyway. The room is quite large for Manhattan, with a lovely sitting area across from the gigantic bed. Our butler quickly introduced herself, bringing us coffee and tea service, even offering our friends who were visiting us for a couple hours. For dinner, we headed out to Le Bernadin, which the concierge helped us secure. Unfortunately, the Bentley was taken (not surprising), so we walked a couple blocks instead. On returning, we noticed a huge refill of chocolates, with proper turndown service, and the most comfortable bedding I have ever experienced at a hotel. It was truly delightful. The shower pressure was strong, and I liked the European feel of the shower setup. I do have mixed feelings though, considering the caliber of the hotel as a flagship. I was expecting separate shower and bathtub, as well as WC, but it was a conventional bathroom setup, albeit with double sinks. The TV in the bathroom did not work. The bedroom was clean, but some of the furniture was a little beat up. And the design was walking the fine line between bold and gaudy. I would say it was still on the side of bold, but I didn't find it very elegant. The biggest disappointment was with breakfast, where we waited a long time to be seated, and an even longer time to be served. The entire dining room seemed to be in disarray, although it was clear something was backed up in the kitchen, as there were plenty of servers. When the breakfast finally did come out, it was fine, nothing out of the ordinary. Now, I understand how a kitchen may be backed up at 10AM, but I do think the servers could have made things better by providing pastries and coffee/tea service to those waiting, instead of rushing in and out of the kitchen while diners were left frustrated. I brought this up to the front desk when checking out, and they apologized profusely, and offered me a truly generous number of SPG points as an apology. This was an appropriate gesture that I appreciated and accepted. So the front desk and housekeeping/butler service was outstanding. I couldn't have been more pleased. But the physical plant was not impressive by ultra luxury standards, even a tad disappointing, and breakfast service was a disaster. And that's why I have mixed feelings.",Couples,14,Massachusetts,Dance,Boston,M,No,02/07,Exceptional customer service amid mixed feelings

This is a great historic property with a lot of character and amazing architecture. The marble stairwells are amazing to see. Check in was very quick and efficient on a Friday evening. We were greeted promptly and given all the information we needed to know to make the most of our stay. Based on our SPG Platinum status, we were upgraded to a Deluxe Suite with Butler. The room was very nice. Separate living room with fireplace, large bathroom with separate tub and shower and plenty of room to relax and rest after spending a day walking around NYC. The butler service is very much worth it. They greet you as soon as you get to your room. They explain all the operational aspects of the room and take care of any needs you have. Excellent service all weekend from the butlers!! The hotel is pretty well located. Easy walk to Metro Subway, many restaurants, all the shopping along 5th Avenue and Times Square.

Its pricey, but so is everything in NYC. the staff at this hotel are on a par with Claridges, and although the public rooms, restaurant and bar aren't as good, that has more to do with space issues than anything else.the one downside is that the hotel is v close to Trump Tower so i was kept awake almost all night by the demonstrators against his future rule. Not the fault of the hotel of course, which will now become my regular joint when in the Big Apple.

I love this kind of opulence in a hotel and there are fewer and fewer of them as modern simplicity takes over. I felt that the service was second to none, from the friendly doorman to the front desk and room service, all were superb! It's crazy trying to pick a place to stay in NY so staying here felt like a little retreat from all the craziness and business just steps outside the hotel! The room was beautiful and again felt like a step back to a time of grandeur. I wish I had more time to enjoy it but with a million things to see and do in NY.....The location is great and I walked about 10 minutes to St Patricks Cathedral. All the shopping along 5th Ave was just around the corner! I think the main thing to figure out in NY is what you are planning to see and do and pick your hotel based on that. I did take the subway, but I'm not crazy about it as I come from a small town. Taxi's aren't my thing either and they seemed to be hard to flag down, so I always rely on what I can see and do on foot around the hotel.
