We were seated in the very pretty patio area. The food was pretty good--not great, but not bad. My companion and I both had kebabs. They were fine, but the accompanying tzatziki sauce was ice-cold. After our plates were cleared, my friend and I discussed having an after-dinner coffee--but the waitress vanished. When she reappeared--about 15 minutes later--she plopped the check on our table without even asking if we wanted anything else. Um, okay. The place was nearly empty at ""dinnertime,"" so there's that. Really wouldn't recommend this place and can't imagine ever going back.",Couples,,NA,Dance,,NA,No,10/14,It's okay . . .

It's moderately priced and you will usually end up spending $20/person for your meal with 2 people consisting of a small appetizer for 2, plus 2 main courses without soft drinks... So just keep that in mind. It is BYOB, so at least it helps with keeping the cost reasonable. The food is usually excellent though it depends on which time and day of the week you go... We usually have their shrimp & vegetable thai stir fry and their catfish + veggy basil stir fry... The pad thai is also pretty tasty... Their Tiger cry is awesome. The curry is good except for the chicken they use which can taste pretty blend. Their ONLY MAJOR drawback is that they DON'T GIVE RICE with dishes & the rice you buy for $1 or $2 extra is very poor quality rice. Something they really need to improve upon. Also some of the meat like ""bbq pork"" used is pretty poor quality too, they should improve upon that. The seafood & tofu are pretty good quality though & the beef too...

It is my personal favorite, and it's never disappointing. My dining companion always orders something different, and each time he loves what he ordered. The most recent visit, he ordered the Curry. I tried some and it was DELICIOUS. Sometimes, the restaurant can be feel a little small. The tables are small, so if you have more than two people, and coats or handbags, it can get a little awkward. Also, the last time I was there, there was a hipster couple with the toddler in tow who screamed the whole time, shrieking in excitement without hesitation. That became annoying, but it is certainly not the restaurants fault that some diners believe that toddlers belong in quiet restaurants. The next couple that entered brought a baby. So, the soft, peaceful music and conversation was destroyed by the time our main course arrived. Ugh. But, you have to try this place.

A small glitch was that when I went, they were unable to find my reservation. Having said that, after my explanation, I was rapidly seated. I had the filet and a side of spinach with Parmesan. The bearnaise sauce came on the side when my naked steak arrived. I finished with a slice of key lime pie. I ate in the bar and the bartender took my order. He was very competent and courteous, providing informed suggestions. The meal was filling. Although the spinach side was a little salty, it cannot be surprising as it is made with Parmesan.

First, I enjoy gimlets for two reasons-I like gin and I like things that are refreshing but not overly tart or thick. This drink was both of those things. Took a few sips and push it aside. The main issue was the ribeye, which I ordered with ""au poivre on the side"" and ""medium-rare plus,"" obviously between medium and medium-rare. I did not realize that ""au poivre"" meant it was cooked au poivre, and I assumed it was the cognac-cream peppercorn sauce instead. I'll take some of the blame for that one, but when I said ""on the side,"" perhaps the bartender should have realized my mistake and corrected me, thus preventing the steak from being the saltiest thing on the planet... The second issue I will not accept any blame for...the steak was flat-out cooked rare, pink all the way through (not simply in the center how medium-rare is supposed to be). Perhaps I should have expected this since when I stressed to the bartender that I wanted it cooked ""medium-rare plus,"" I pretty much got the ""yeah, okay, whatever"" treatment parents get from their teenage daughters when they advise them not to talk to boys or play the music too loudly when driving. As with the gimlet, I took a couple bites, pushed it aside and asked for my check. I wanted to order the chocolate pie (which I know is great from previous trips to Gilt Bar), but was in such a foul mood that I passed on it (went and got it next door instead). This was a ""one-star"" experience in every sense, but I'm not giving that to Bavette's because I know from past experiences with its sister restaurants that it knows how to make good food and drinks (plus I prefer dark, dimly lit places with high-brow jazz). This, then, is not a complaint of the company or the restaurant but rather of a single night that is most likely an outlier. I know that if I came on a less-busy knight and perhaps with a different bar staff, the gimlet would have tasted like a gimlet, and the ribeye would have been the great thing that all the other reviewers rave about. On this night, however, it was not meant to be. It was crowded on that Friday night, and perhaps that played a role. Bavette's may want to adopt the approach its next-door-neighbor has and have the host escort people downstairs ONLY IF THERE IS SEATING AVAILABLE, as well put less tables down there. It was crowded that night, which may have contributed to the ""I wish I was elsewhere or even perhaps dead"" vibe the bar staff was giving off and the rushed nature of the kitchen staff. The good news is that I received an email from Amazon shortly after, stating that my two medical books had sold. Covered the cost of the meal and then some, so just call me ""Even Steven.""",Solo,1,NA,Dance,,M,No,06/16,"""Just an 'off-night', perhaps?"""

It came recommended to me by friends and I really wanted Cedars to be my regular spot. That is why I gave it 3 chances. Visit #1 I carried out an order of lamb chops with rice. The total of the order was $25 with tax and tip. The lentil soup was decent. The lamb chops we asked for medium rare, but they were more towards a medium to well. They were good. We got a good amount of veggies (zucchini, broccoli, onions, etc) and rice to go with 3 medium chops. A little over-priced for what we got, but good. The service was extremely bad. The girl seemed less than pleased to be working.. Visit #2 I called for delivery service. The delivery man showed up stoned (he reeked). He also charged us extra for delivery, claiming the girl on the phone was new and didn't know we are out of area.... We live within walking distance from the restaurant, so I was a little irritated by this, but I moved on. Then, the chops were smaller than the first time we ordered them and they were clearly well done ( I ordered medium rare) and there was more fat than meat. The potatoes were extremely tasteless and bland. For veggies they gave us 8 grape tomatoes. The Egyptian lentil soup was delicious but this visit cost me $32 with tax and delivery and tip. So not worth it... Visit #3 Third time is a charm, right? I wanted to try one more time. I ordered ahead for pickup. I ordered the lamb, rare and was quoted a time of 15 minutes.. I gave them an extra 5-10 minutes allowing for the fact that it was lunch time. My food was not ready when I arrived, so I waited. No problem. About 10 mins later, the server seemed displeased to be doing takeout orders... the restaurant was less than 50% full, so I wonder how they operate when they get full. I paid the $25 for my entree and drive the 10 blocks home. The chops are extremely well done (I ordered them rare hoping to get closer to medium rare) they are mostly fat and bone, the fries are also extremely bland and for my veggie i got 3 grape tomatoes, one 2x2 slice of onion and a tiny broccoli floret. The soups are decent. I may try something else on the menu, but a friend once brought over some veggie dishes from this restaurant for me to try and they weren't anything special for the prices they charge... their sides and desserts are especially overpriced in comparison to other middle eastern restaurants.

I chose McCormick & Schmick's at 41 East Chestnut Street for several reasons. I was acquainted with the signature seafood dishes that have made this nation chain very popular from coast to coast. And I was anxious to have dinner in one of their cushy private seating areas. We had a great time. So I've always had a soft spot in my heart for McCormick & Schmick's. Established in the 1970s in more than 80 restaurants across the country, the franchise joined Landry's in 2012, expanding to more than 300 restaurants, hotels and entertainment centers nationwide. But the M&S on Chestnut, one of five M&S locations in the Chicago area, hasn't changed. The fresh seafood arrives daily from sources on the Pacific Rim, Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. You can't get better salmon or Mahi-Mahi or flounder or swordfish or cobia or trout or whitefish or sea scallops or Chilean sea bass anywhere in the city. And I try to oblige my more fish, less meat diet as often as possible. For starters, my wife and I chose Maine lobster bisque and chilled jumbo shrimp cocktail. My wife didn't have to look twice at the menu. If Mahi-Mahi is listed, she orders it. And I've come to enjoy the Hawaiian delicacy, too. But I opted for Atlantic salmon on this occasion. We differed on dessert, too. We usually share but she was determined to try the chef's special, the Chocolate Bag, white chocolate mousse and fresh berries topped with whipped cream, while I couldn't resist the Upside Down Candied Walnut Apple Pie with warm caramel sauce and cinnamon ice cream.

Breakfast is an all-day event with smoked corned beef hash and eggs, shrimp and cheesy grits, French toast, spiced apple pancakes, Creole crab crumpets, Spanish omelette, Elvis waffles, biscuits and gravy and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes. Snacks? Choose chicken fingers, shrimp cocktail, nachos, garlic bread or hot crab dip. Sandwiches? The classic cheeseburger draws rave reviews. Other tasty options are patty melt, Reuben, BBQ pork, braised beef, whitefish, smoked turkey, chicken and shrimp. Dinner? Best bets are chicken pot pie, fried chicken, beef stroganoff and sauteed shrimp and brown buttered shrimp. Wash it all down with orange juice, lemonade or root beer.

Service at the front desk was cordial, however, was not given any special treatment upon check-in towards my Starwood status. My room essentially overlooked a parking garage and was quite small. I also declined housekeeping for the ""GoGreen"" effort and I never received my additional Starwood points. Would keep it as a consideration because it is a Starwood hotel, but will most likely try staying in other hotels first.",Solo,3,New York,Dance,New York City,NA,No,04/10,"Great location, Nice hotel, Not much else going on"

I walked everywhere and have a fabulous time - then was treated to beautiful views from my room when I got back for a rest. The rooms were large, furnished well and very clean. There was no noise despite the busy location and I slept wonderfully. I would love to come back here again!",Solo,,Pennsylvania,Dance,Pittsburgh,NA,No,03/13,Amazing location with unbeatable views!

There were however multiple small service failures, most commonly at the front desk that I wouldn't have expected for a hotel at all at this price point. Definitely one of the less motivated hotel teams I have come across. There was also non existent luggage assistance on both my arrival and departure so it seems all the more strange that there is actually a desk dedicated to luggage assistance. The tip money that I usually pay to bell desk staff was instead given to my uber drivers because they were far more helpful with my luggage than a single Westin staff member. Concierge assistance was good and staff pleasant however the concierge desk was often closed during my stay and guests were directed to the front desk instead. The executive lounge is on the top floor and breakfast offering is decent although it was pretty much exactly the same two days in a row. I wouldn't want to have stayed any longer. Although it wasn't terrible, I'd be inclined to stay somewhere else next time I'm in the city in the hope of finding a better value proposition for a five star hotel.",Solo,,China,Dance,Hong Kong,NA,No,04/13,A little expensive for the offering
