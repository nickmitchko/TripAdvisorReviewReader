The hot water in the shower wasn't. I actually had goosebumps when I stepped out of the shower the first night I was there, and yes, the heat was on. The shower head must have been installed by someone 7'6"" as trying to adjust it was impossible because I couldn't reach it. Only once was the water warm enough (not hot) to leave some steam on the bathroom mirror. If you have back issues as I do, a hot shower to help loosen tight back muscles is a must. 2. I spent two and a half hours my first day there tracking down a place that sold postcards, which are a lot harder to find than they used to be. I went to send out 11 of them to places within the U.S. and overseas on Christmas Eve, and I asked Matt at the front desk if there was a post office in the area. He shook his head no. ""No? I don't mind walking,"" I said, as I log about 7-8 miles per day when I am in Philly. ""No, give them to us. We have mail pick-up and I will put them in the bin to go out."" I gave him the postcards and that was that. Yesterday (six days later) none of the 11 had reached their destination, so I called the hotel. Once again, I spoke to Matt. I explained the situation and said that at least some of them should have been received by now, as one was going elsewhere in PA and one was going to Brooklyn. He went to check the outgoing bin and came back and said they were not in there. I then asked if they had a regular mail carrier whom they could ask and see if he/she remembered picking the mail up that day. ""Well, I can't ask the post office if they had a piece of mail going to Brooklyn,"" was the reply. I of course agreed with him and said I understood that much. The phone call ended with my asking him to speak to their carrier anyway, and he said he would and we would talk soon. That was yesterday, and I have heard nothing. And the postcards have still not been received by anyone, so they obviously never made it to the post office as it's been a full week. I am perfectly aware that the hotel isn't responsible for what happens to the mail after it leaves the hotel, but the comment about the mail going to Brooklyn was flippant and uncalled for. I also had asked for a post office location and was told to give the mail to them instead. So, I've lost the money I spent on postcards, and international and domestic stamps, as well as spent a lot of time trying to find the postcards to begin with instead of doing something else. I'm also very disappointed that there was no follow-up when there should have been. Don't say you'll call someone later if you are not going to do so. The phone call left a worse impression than the postcards not arriving. The pros: The staff were very nice, and the room was very clean.",Solo,,Maryland,Dance,Baltimore,NA,No,06/15,I so wanted to give this place a better review

The hotel itself was beautiful and they had champagne, Godiva truffles & chocolate covered strawberries in our room since we booked the Romance Package. To start, at check in there was an irate man next to us at te counter. He was being denied check in because he had a prepaid debit card and not an actual banking card. I also had a prepaid debit card because I have dealt with hotels overcharging me and stealing my money or taking forever to refund me. But either way Thomas (the man checking us in) denied my prepaid card as well and luckily my fiance' had his credit card. I dont see why a prepaid card matters because either the money is there or it isnt. These arent just a basic Visa gift card, they are prepaid debit cards that a have an account number & routing number. It's still through a bank. A lot of people that have dealt with fraud & theft like me use them these days. I made my reservation with this prepaid debit card so if they arent excepted that shouldve been stated or verified before I came to check in. After that we were supposed to received 2 free drinks at Con Murphy's, Thomas said just give them our room number and it will be fine. Not that case! We were seated at Con Murphy's for lunch and my fiance"" had to get up and go back to the counter to get our VOUCHERS that allowed us 2 free drinks. In the morning our romance package included free BREAKFAST IN BED so we asked Thomas how do we go about that. Thomas told us to call in our order and have it delivered to the room or the lobby and it will be handled. Again, not the case! The worker at Con Murphy said that the breakfast once again needed a VOUCHER that we never received and it was for restaurant dining not in room dining. The girl at Con Murphy's was nice and patient so she made the exception and delivered our breakfast to our room and comp'd it but she still needed a voucher which we didnt have. So my fiance' had to throw on clothes and go downstairs witht the girl and get a voucher from the front desk and by the time he got back upstairs our food was cold. Also, the food was free but disgusting. I was emailed a confirmation from Mathhew B. ( a receptionist) that my check out time would be 1pm since I booked the Romance Package, Thomas and another woman up front both stated that check out time was 12pm, no exceptions.

I let the hostess know this when I left the lounge, and she was very apologetic. The location of the hotel is great.

This hotel advertises itself as a ""luxury"" hotel, it is a renovated apartment building well located near Rittenhouse Square (which as you will read is it's best feature). Upon arriving at my room, I immediately notice how small it was, so much that I immediately go searching for the picture on hotels.com: nowhere close to the pictures. Takes not even 1 hour to realize that on top of being smaller than advertised, they gave me the worst room of the floor: right in front of elevators where everybody gathers and speaks as if nobody is around. Add to that that ALL room doors have a huge gap on the bottom so you will hear not only hallway conversations but the incessant slamming of doors. Not the hotel's fault that people have no manners and voluntarily slam doors but hotel's responsibility to mitigate by installing springs behind doors. After realizing I would pay $375/night to sleep in worst conditions than in a tent, I inquired with front desk to change rooms. The clerk informed me that yes, I should expect this type of small rooms because I reserved through hotels.com and they give out their worst rooms to people who reserve through those (aka rack rates) however he understood when I showed the gap at bottom of door and noise from being in front of elevators. He changed my room immediately and at that point, I would have been satisfied. Unfortunately, only when arriving at second room did I realize ALL rooms have door gaps at the bottom therefore the slamming would not stop (again, remember that you're paying $375/night for having the privilege of hearing people slam doors, including room cleaners in the morning who scream at each other in front of your door AND make it a point to slam doors like there was no tomorrow). Icing on the cake, there was a dog left barking next door by it's owner (not the hotel's fault) even though hotel is not pet friendly. Even though I reported it to front desk on 3 separate instances over 6 hours, I paid $375/night to hear a dog bark next to my room (their responsibility to deliver a quiet environment). On a final note, the cleanliness of the room was the worst I have experienced in years and I will let you look at the pictures to draw your own conclusions, nothing else to add. In the end, worst $750 I have spent all year and staying at this hotel certainly contributed to my worst weekend of 2016. Hope I can save you the trouble and heartache of having to constantly battle with management to get a minimum of value for my hard earned money.

I'll start with the positive/neutral items: - Great location in Center City, incredibly close and within walking distance to Philly's great nightlife and shopping. - I booked using SPG points, and would say that I received tremendous value for the point spend. - Fitness center and bar were on-par with what I'd expect from a Westin property. Kudos to the great customer service and pleasant attitude from all of the bartenders. - Same as above with room in general - fairly on-par with Westin standards. As for the not so pleasant aspects and why I would only rate this property 3 stars: - Bathroom was small and seemed dated - below average from my experiences. - What really detracted from this trip was the general demeanor of many of the staff, and the fact that the property really blew it in terms of delivering the ""Westin Weekend"" experience. With the exception of the bartenders, none of the staff with whom I interacted were particularly pleasant people - few smiles, seemingly irritated to serve me. Like many folks, I gravitate to Westin properties for quick weekend trips due largely to their ""Westin Weekend"" promotion. Apparently this hotel was over-subscribed this weekend. When I requested a 4 PM late checkout (I'm a SPG Gold Member), I was curtly informed by one of the staff members that 1:30 PM was the absolute latest available. No apology, no smile. That by itself wouldn't be a big deal - I understand how the industry works, and I would be super irritated if my room weren't available for a 3 PM check-in. However, the hotel staff seemed to go out of their way to passively-aggressively suggest that they wanted folks out of their rooms as soon as possible on Sunday. When I arrived back on Saturday night there was a note from the hotel's general manager informing me that they would not be granting any checkout requests after 12 PM for anybody due to it being a ""busy weekend"" - and even offering 1,500 SPG points for folks who checked out before 10 AM. When I called the front desk to confirm my 1:30 late checkout, the staff seemed irritated that I even bothered to ask, but said that I was all set. Then this morning, I was interrupted not once, but three times - twice by housekeeping, once by somebody looking to check the minibar - before 1:30, despite having my ""do not disturb"" sign displayed. Again, it was very clear that they wanted me out as soon as possible to make way for arriving guests. It's quite irritating as a Gold member, as I find it ludicrous to think that this property has hordes of Platinum elites arriving early on Sunday. I'll comment further that I've had similar weekend experiences with other Westin properties, though without the poor attitude experienced here. If Starwood is going to create an entire marketing campaign around the Westin Weekend experience - including a standard 3 PM check out on Sunday - they need to be able to more consistently execute on it. And again, I'm a Gold member - I imagine the general public must be even more consistently disappointed when they expect a slow and relaxed Sunday, only to have the hotel try to push them out of their rooms as soon as possible. Overall, I had a great trip. I actually would book this property again due to the on-par quality, good price-for-value, and great location, and also because I want to give them the benefit of the doubt - this was unusually poor customer service from a Westin, so I'll assume they were just having a bad weekend due to being busier than expected.",Solo,12,New York,Dance,New York City,M,No,10/16,Weekend in Philadelphia

(The rooms also come with two free bottles of water). Accommodating and pleasant staff, they held our bags after checkout for a few hours for free which was nice. The cons of this hotel are: Hotwire stated that they had a “free shuttle” on their hot rate description. They actually do not have a free shuttle to the airport, which was a bummer. This might be a hotwire issue though, and not necessarily a Warwick hotel issue. Had to get an Uber to the airport instead which was an extra $15.00. Parking is expensive- $38.00 per night for self-parking, valet is $45.00 per night. (if you drive to the hotel). We were in room 624-on the 6th floor, right next to the elevators.

The experience in this hotel was awful from the minute we arrived to us checking out. Upon checking in they could not find our reservation and made us wait a very long time with no explanation of what was happening. The staff was not helpful and made it seem like it was our fault that our reservation was not coming up in their system. We even had our confirmation and information all printed and gave it to the front desk and they were expecting us to have all the answers. After a very long time and no compensation for this we finally went to our room. There were cracks on the ceiling and stains in the tub. The hot water lasted for a very short time in the shower. We then went out the next day and when we came back to our room to shower before our dinner reservations, our key did not work. The maid saw us down the hall and said that the room was supposed to be checked out and we had to go collect our bags from a different location. The only problem with this was that we still had another night for our reservation. We then went back down to the lobby and waited once again for a problem to be solved, missing our reservations to the restaurant down the street in the process. The gentleman that helped us was kind enough to give us access to a small area on the 11th floor that provided drinks and light food. We decided to check this area out since we missed our reservations, only to be disappointed an almost empty fridge and bar and a minimal selections of ravaged snacks. We went about the rest of our trip and the next day we checked out. Upon checkout we noticed a charge for an upgrade to our room for $170. We turned back to the desk and were given no explanation of what that charge was for but it was removed. My only assumption could be that we were charged that much for the area that provided drinks and snacks. We then gave our ticket to the valet parking and waited 30 minutes to pick up our car, when there was no one else in front of us. This was my first time in Philadelphia and I would tell anyone that is in the area or any area that offers a Warwick Hotel to stay anywhere else and do yourself a favor and find another hotel.",Couples,,NA,Dance,,M,No,02/17,Awful experience from check in to checkout.

We spent all of our first full day out of our room, returning nearly at dinner, and our room hadn't been cleaned. At that point, we figured, Forget it, we'll call down for anything we need, and we hung up the Do Not Disturb sign since we would be in and out much more frequently for the rest of the evening.

Great location, very friendly staff overall. Check in was fast and efficient. Ordered room service and the food was delicious. I loved the design of the hotel, very modern and beautiful. The only thing I was not happy about is that the walls were too thin and you could hear everything from the other rooms, but other than that it was a great stay.",Solo,5,New York,Dance,New York City,M,No,12/08,Lovely stay

Also great location for morning run, Franklin parkway is just block away on the west. Room is reasonable for a $200 per night stay. Book early to get a room with a good view. ( I got inside view of the elevator bank but I'm not complaining.) i can work with the limited desk space, and that doesn't bother me much. Staff are very friendly to me. The fridge is full of merchandise as seen in pictures. I'm not complaining neither. But it's 2016 and wifi in room still cost $3 to start? Or did i miss something? Anyways, I enjoyed my stay with le meridien in philly. I would recommend friends stay in here as well.

First, my room was big with a hall to the main area. It was designed with luxury in mind and you won't be disappointed. Second, the location was amazing. Just a few blocks from the Reading Terminal Market, it will be easy to walk to wherever you need to go in Center City. Third, excellent customer service. Bill and Katie at the front desk were amazing. They helped me get a great room and took care of me during my entire stay.
