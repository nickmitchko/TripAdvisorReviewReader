After asking me to take a seat and some funny jokes and anecdotes about Australia (Bravo you certainly know your history!) this convict descendant was then issued his room key. So up I go to Room 1003. The room was amazing, I felt as if I was staying in a room from back in colonial times but with modern twists. The bed was amazing, Decent size room, Nice couch, Bathroom was spacious with Gilchrist & Soames toiletries , Shower/Tub combination. Nice LCD tv and the air conditioning working well since that particular day was warm. View was decent of the downtown area. I collapsed into bed and it was very comfortable, The next morning I got up, Showered and headed down to breakfast. This is where the experience soured a little...So Russell had told me breakfast was served on the 2nd floor (???) I remember it was just above the lobby, Anyway so I got out of the elevator and immediately notice people sitting at tables, So I wait thinking someone will come seat me....Waiting...Waiting.... And as I try to flag attention of staff member she ignores me and keeps walking. So I decide to just grab some cereal , Make my own coffee and sit down, Finish the meal, stand up and go to walk away and notice same staff member glaring at me.....Maybe she was upset I didn't tip her (But why should I if I got no service??) but maybe clearer interaction for staff and guests could be something to think about, I could of been anyone who walked off the street since they didn't check.

I've stayed for different lengths of time and also in most of the different types of rooms, if not all. Sometimes I are traveling on business and sometimes I stay there while I'm in town visiting my family. It is my home away from home! This fabulous boutique hotel is perfect for any occasion. Why I love it most: It is a luxurious establishment located right in the middle of ""Uptown"" Galleria area. This is a beautiful upscale area surrounded by some fabulous restaurants, shops, and even a couple of spas. The Galleria Mall is just a few blocks away! It is one of my favorite areas in Houston! The property itself is exquisite and decorated with the utmost discrimination and beautifully appointed. The restaurant is wonderful and so is the lounge area. I love to grab dinner or a drink and sit outside poolside on a nice evening. The pool area is gorgeous with lavish landscaping and lovely music piped outside. If you are lucky you will catch some live music right there at the lounge. I also enjoy the fact that i can stay at a luxurious hotel that accepts my pets so that they can travel along with me. The hotel is beautiful and very well cared for. Sometimes you will arrive at another hotel and your ""pet room"" smells just like what it is. But at Granduca, you will never encounter this problem. There is not a bad view from any room. Each room is exquisitely decorated and immaculately cleaned down to the finest detail. You will not be disappointed!

The rooms were a little small but they were still very nice. The employees that worked in valet, housekeeping, room service, concierge desk and at the hotel shuttle service were exceptional! There was one young man at the front desk that checked me out that was really good as well. I enjoyed my stay because of them. However their are some areas that need improvement. I called the hotel about three times before my stay to ask questions so I could be prepared before I got there. The three times I called the person on the phone seemed annoyed by my questions. I booked my stay on trip advisor and its was my first time using a third party to book my hotel reservations. The second time I called I asked about any extra fees that I may need to be prepared to pay. I was transferred to reservations and they told me since I had booked on trip advisor whatever fee I was charged on the site should be all I needed. I was like ok because I know most hotels like this charge fees for every night you stay to cover any charges you might make, the incidental fee. I made sure I had about 100 extra plus my room fee and gas money just in case. After an 8 hour and 30 minute drive I rolled into the hotel excited about my stay, I was going to see the Beyonce concert the next day. I'm in Texas working on special assignment with my job until January and I also wanted to see more of what the state had to offer. Upon arrival I was told that because I was paying with my debit card that had I had to pay a $200 incidental fee up front. I told the young lady that I called ahead about extra fees and I wasn't told about this. I told her I only had a little over $600 on my debit card and that I could transfer the room fee over to one of my credit cards to get around the debit card upfront charge. She went and got the manger that was working that night. They both come out and the manger said because she said your really nice we are going to charge you for the stay on your card tonight and you can give us another card for your incidentals. I was like if I give you a credit card will I still need to pay the $200 fee upfront she said yes. I was confused because I thought I needed to pay the fee upfront because I was paying with a debit card. I was panicking inside trying to figure out what I could do because I wasn't going to have any extra money until I was paid on Friday. While I was thinking the manger started asking was I excited for the concert. I was like well I was and she proceeded to tell me that she could have told me me no that that would accept my card. She also added that my rooms were really discounted and I got a bunch of extra stuff since I booked on trip advisor. I was taken aback. Who in there right mind is going to to be excited for a concert when they are faced with the possibility that they won't have anywhere to stay for the next three days. The way she spoke to me was like I should be grateful that I even had the opportunity to stay there. How dare you! I agreed to letting them put the room balance on my card and using another card for my incidentals. The young lady said she tried to run my card twice and it wouldn't go through. I called my bank and talked to them and they said there was never an attempt to run my card made. I walked back up to the desk and told the young lady what my bank had said while they were on the phone and miraculously my card worked. I was calling bull crap on that one. I don't believe she ever ran it like my bank said. While I had my bank on the phone I told them what was happening and they agreed to raise the credit limit on a credit card I had with them so that I didn't have to use my spending money on the incidentals. So it worked out in the end but that whole check in experience pissed me off since I had called to inquire about extra fees and the way the manger talked to me was out of line. I would love to say I would stay here again but I probably won't because of this incident.",Solo,,Virginia,Dance,Charlottesville,NA,Yes,05/16,Nice hotel but I had an issue with the way I was treated at check in

It did remind us of the Frankfurt Hilton in layout and ambience. We received a warm welcome at the check-in. The Valet parking is expensive at $35 a night, but it is downtown Houston. Valet team was very professional. Do call 10-15 minutes before you need the car, as this is a 1,200 room hotel! They do offer less expensive self-parking. It was so busy the night that we were there that we could not easily gain access to the restaurant or the lobby bar... but this is Downtown Houston, so we enjoyed some wine in our very nice room and watched the sunset. We were there for the Annual Heart Ball, and it was a superbly run event. We were tremendously impressed with the food, service and wine at the dinner. They served Lobster and Short Ribs as the main course, and it was as good as a meal in one of Houston's finest restaurants. A major compliment for Hotel Banquet food! One Major Issue: Hilton must own stock in a Water Softening Company! But I am going to save them more than $100,000 a year in water loss, if they will take my suggestion! TURN DOWN THE WATER SOFTENER! We both had to shower Extra-Long to even feel clean, as the excessive water softener treatment leaves a slimy, soapy feeling for a very long time. A quick 5-minute shower took more than 10 minutes, then we just gave up. Multiply that extra time per shower, times 1,200 room, time 365 nights, and you get my point.

First, the Spa had no records of our reservations. This was quite disappointing but they were able to fix it albeit a change in timing. The room was comfortable but the proximity of the tramway is definitely a disturbance. Make sure you get a room not facing that noisy thing. The restaurant, Main, was nice for breakfast but most dishes and silverware were dirty. We had to ask for a clean cup for coffee. Finally at check out, we were given 2 vouchers or drinks and chocolate truffles. Why not at check in still baffles us. And the valet was excessively slow and he he wait way too long.

Typical American hotel for Americans. Its not adapted for foreigners. I arrived on Monday. I flew 16h non stop from UAE and badly wanted to have a massage, but guess what! Exactly!!! SPA is closed on Monday! Ridiculous! I was thinking why don't you close reception on Wednesday lets say? I had no energy to make a drama and Usama (if Im not mistaken, Arab guy) who did a check-in for me was very helpful. He arranged an appointment for me in another SPA near by with a car drop off and pick up. Good job! Guest room and hotel: Inside hotel looks like a business office. People in suits are moving like a tennis ball up and down. I understand this is not a resort, its a business hotel but I wish there was at least a small personal touch.This is still a hospitality. But unfortunately there was no atmosphere of home. I stayed in SPA superior room. Honestly there is no benefits in that. At least not in my experience. Bathtub in a middle of the hallway in front of the door made me laugh. It doesn't look that smart and classy as it is on the pics. In fact I never used it. There is no view from this hotel, don't bother yourself about that. But its ok. I LOVED my bed, pillows and all the linen. I was sleeping like a baby. Very good in terms of privacy - at least my room, which was specific one. Furniture and amenities are all good. Had some issues with hot water on arrival day but engineering came so fast and fixed in 2 min - well done! HSK worked also excellent. Wi-Fi works perfect - that what I was need ))) SPA: Regardless I was upset with closure on Monday I spent a lot of time in SPA. Therapists are very professional. Raliat at SPA reception is so lovely. Every time i passed by she was greeting me by name and she was patient when I annoyed her with lots of question about all the treatments. I have to admit that different days she had different uniform and it's really a great idea. I loved her dresses. Amazing girl!!! Very big thank for her kind assistance. Also champagne before the treatment is always better than tea :))))) Thank everybody there. F&B: Breakfast is 1000000% MARVELOUS!!!! Staff at the breakfast are super attentive and efficient. Everybody remembered me but I believe its only because I always was the youngest one and alone )))) Food is great. Selection of food just WOW. My taste. I loved watermelon and blackberries. Breakfast upstairs in a lounge was very modest compare to the main one. Dinner and lunch menu is so so, not much choice. But all the food what I tried was really good! Thanks to all chefs who was cooking for me and for service. IRD I believe taking food from same kitchen. Same poor menu but still tasty. Please add more salads, more soup, more main course. And its a pity that in 5* hotel you have only one restaurant which is all day dining. I stayed 5 days and in the end was fed up... I didn't know what else I didn't try from the menu. STAFF: Staff are always busy, but polite and friendly. Would be good if there will be some small personal touches. Address guest by name, remember their room number when you already spoke many times. Sometimes you need to think before guest ask, that's what I call excellent service. But in general no complains. One more thing. Have to admit uniform of reception / concierge are so nice! Very presentable and fancy. Blue color really impressed me. Uniform of waiters are also great. Grooming, behavior, attitude - perfect. Staff know what they do. Guys from parking are all very helpful and welcoming. It was so nice that you were taking me for some of my business around downtown and one time, when all valets were busy Usama from FO drop me off to the mall. Highly appreciated! Honestly this hotel made my stay in boring Houston. There are some things to work on it but in general everything was very good. If you on business for few days - yes its worth it, I would recommend to stay in this hotel.

The Houstonian employees go out of their way to make sure each and every stay is perfect. From the simplest thing like sending a car service to pick us up from the Spa so we wouldn't ruin our hair on the walk back to the wedding ceremony was much appreciated. The Houstonian goes above and beyond all the time! Pool - The cold towels and fresh fruit were a perfect treat on a hot day. Many thanks to the pool staff for exceptional service at our rehearsal dinner by the pool. Club level - Our favorite part of the day was happy hour on the 4th floor in the lounge. Totally worth the $60 for breakfast in the morning, happy hour in the afternoon and after dinner drinks! All self serve! Trellis Spa - BEST SPA in Houston!!! Be sure to go early and enjoy the relaxation room. It was my husband's favorite and he doesn't typically like spas at all. Also, the lump crab salad and cantaloupe juice is the perfect spa lunch.

The building exterior conceals the charm of this place even more than the setting. It looks more like a sprawling '70s era hospital or high school. But once you enter the Houstonian, you find yourself in what feels like a cozy, old world territorial Texan hunting lodge. Tall wainscot and stucco walls, rough-hewn ceiling timbers sporting antler chandeliers over patchwork pecan and walnut parquet, a mammoth stone fireplace, elk and pheasant and fox-hunt tapestries and bronzes all support the rustic class of the place. You'd think Sam Houston would be speaking soon from the lobby balcony (just in front of the Sitting Bull portrait). There's a quiet, friendly bar, two high-end restaurants (superb fare, but a little too high-finger for my tastes), an excellent pool grill, and attentive staff members and concierge adding to the overall Texas ritz. But the real hidden gem in the Houstonian is actually standing behind the hotel. And I'm not talking about the sprawling family-friendly pool, or the strictly regulated Olympic size lap pool, or the cozy ""Quiet"" pool intended for adults (though today's young bombastic families lack yesteryear's respectful decorum and invade it regularly). No. The real gem here, the amenity that vaults this place above all others is the 175,000 sq ft Houstonian Health Club, second to none in the world, the use of which is included in your hotel stay! Two stories of modern workout perfection include a yoga room, a full-sized basketball court, handball courts, a Pilates and Gyrotonic studio, a boxing gym, a power lifting studio, a smoothie and brunch cafe, an upstairs workout room nearly as large as a football field stocked with scores of every possible exercise machinery, a one-mile AstroTurf padded jogging trail circumventing the fauna and floral laced grounds, and four comfortable air conditioned indoor tennis courts (as well as seven outdoor tennis and squash courts), truly a health freak's Walhalla. We've been coming here for nearly a decade and have always had trouble finding fault with the place. Sure, the rooms are smaller than most, the bathrooms, while well appointed, are cramped, and the closets tiny. But the location, close to the Galleria and scores of some of Houstons finest restaurants, as well as parks, golf courses, Rice Village and River Oaks makes this place hard to beat.

Got to IAH and took a supershuttle to the hotel, The first thing I noticed was it appeared to be on the edge of the downtown area, Next to Discovery Green which has a nice lake and parkland to walk through. I walked in and the pleasant girl behind the counter issued me Room 1003, Up I go to the 10th floor. Got into the room and it was fantastic! It really was like having your own apartment, Nice little living area with tv and snack fridge, Nice Queen size bed also with TV and VERY comfortable, Bathroom was good with Giovanni Tolietries and from memory the shower had good pressure. Truthfully my view wasn't spectacular but hey....After 24 hours in transit all I wanted was a bed! A friend of mine lives in Houston so he met me for dinner, Within just over a block walk is a Phoenicia Supermarket which also has a great little café open till late, We had dinner there and I can recommend it. We also took a walk in Discovery green which had a band playing by the lake and the restaurant looked good from the meals we could see. it took maybe 10 mins to walk into the main part of downtown but I felt safe and had no problems. The next day I woke up and checked out the pool (Very nice but not enough time to use it), Fitness centre etc. Check out went smoothly and again was polite, The only reason I took a point off is I found the walls between rooms a little thin If I'm back in Houston I'd definitely stay here again!",Solo,40,Australia,Dance,Melbourne,M,No,09/05,Great for it's purpose!

This hotel is simply wonderful. We had a little complication after check in where the incidentals was triple charged on my card. I immediately noticed and went back to the front desk. The front desk representative Mr. Calvin Mendez who checked us in was outstanding. He graciously apologized and even called my bank and courtesy called me in my room to come down that he was fixing it. He got the bank to reverse two on the spot after speaking with me and this was at 10:30 pm. Fast forward...the room is very nice. The bed and pillows are really comfortable, the shower pressure is nice and warm, they have Neutrogena face and body products, and they have a fridge and microwave. Another plus is the Directv in the room and the HD TV channels. My favorite thing was the Keurig coffee machine in the room! They have a saltwater pool outside which I didn't explore too much this time here. They have a great fitness room and a business room with free printing. This morning we tried out breakfast. It was really good. We got the breakfast buffet at the Garden grill restaurant and it didn't disappoint. They have something for everyone. I loved that they had healthier options too such as fresh cut fruit, Splenda packets, smart butter packets, organic herbal tea, whole wheat English muffins etc. They also had your regular items such as waffle machines and pastries but they also had a full hot bar of items which was great. They had items such as eggs, sausage links, sausage patties, biscuits and gravy, breakfast potatoes, bacon, and oatmeal with toppings. They even have made to order eggs and omelettes and just so much more. This room was affordable for everything you get and I just signed up for Hilton rewards also because this experience was great.

What separates them from a mid-tier hotel is the service. When something goest wrong at a Marriott or Hilton, they may apologize, but do not do much to remedy the situation. In lower tier hotels, when there is an issueIf there's a negative review or complaint it usually falls on deaf ears. Conversely, there is the 4S (Four Seasons) Houston. My wife in I were in town, from California, for our godson's birthday party. This was probably our 4-5 time at the 4S, but first time in about a year. When we arrived, they were in the process of taking photos of their beautifully updated lobby and common areas, for their website. The manager politely approached my wife and I asked if we could wait a few minutes. We agreed and she offered us a complementary cocktail for our trouble. Since we do not really drink, we both declined. I then asked about the location of the restroom and another manager asked if we would be interested in having a complimentary lunch? We agreed, had a delicious lunch and I then asked for the check. The server said it was gratis and said we could order more food, cocktails, desert, etc. and that we could stay as long as we wanted. We declined and left a nice tip for our server. This is illustrative of the efforts undertaken to make sure everyone has a delightful stay. If you value service, then this is the place to stay in Houston. The Fairmont is in a great location; especially for shopping at the Galleria; however, the hotel is sort of dated. Nearly all of the common areas (lobby, lounge, bar, restaurant, pool/patio area) were updated in Feb. 2017. There are also 2 brand-new golf simulators in the lobby. The hallways and guest rooms have not been remodeled and are a little dated. I am guessing that is in the works. It is still nice. My only complaint is that our suite got quite warm at night. It had a pesky motion sensor thermostat. They are energy efficient, but if you are sleeping and do not move the air/heat shut off.

The next morning there was extreme bad weather so we decided to wait it out before checking out and had breakfast in their restaurant. There were only 2 tables occupied, but our waiter was busy watching the weather on TV at the bar with his back to us so my husband finally went over and got his attention. We both ordered the Denver omlette which came with potatoes and fruit, but extra for toast. My husband's omlette was fine, but mine did not have any peppers and a couple of pieces of onion only and was over cooked and dry. Don't know if the waiter put the order in wrong or the cook just ran out of peppers. Was not impressed for the $13 price tag. Another negative was the valet parking fee of $36 per night.

It was not busy at all, which I liked. When we checked in, my wife and I were the only ones in the lobby. From Valet (no self-parking owned by hotel), to check-in process, to the room... it was about 15 minutes. Valet service is pricey when compared to other boutique hotels in town. We stayed on the 6th floor. This review is based on what I observed on the 6th floor. This is a nice boutique hotel built in 1926, and remodeled in 2003 and 2009. Very nice and clean hallway. No unpleasant odors, sometimes associated with old buildings that lack maintenance, or need the carpet replaced. I am not trying to say anything bad about old building or the odors. In fact, for some hotels, that old building smells gives character and enhances its true history. The room was nice and with plenty of space. About 30 minutes after arriving to the room, I noticed a stain in the top sheet. I didn't do my usual room check upon arrival, but I am pretty sure it wasn't ours as it was already was dry. So, I just tossed the top sheet on the floor and moved on. One item I look for, is hot water. No problems there. Hot water right away. No temperature fluctuations. That is a big plus for me. Didn't go to the lounge. We went out for dinner. Didn't use the computer, so no comments on wired/wireless access. Shuttle Service: We asked for shuttle service for dinner. From hotel to restaurant, it was quick and easy. As for pick up, I called. About 15 minutes later, nothing. Still waiting for pick up. At the 15 minutes mark, I called. No answer. Two minutes later I called. stated that we were going to walk back. All I got was ""OK"". -- I was expecting more. When we arrived at the hotel, the shuttle vehicle was parked right in front. When we were asked why didn't we call, I stated that we did. Not much follow up after that. We only stayed one night. Bed and pillows were comfortable. We set the temperature low and called it a night. We had a nice, quiet night. This is our fourth in-town boutique hotel. Overall, this is a nice place to stay in downtown Houston.

Before the trip, I called the hotel to make special arrangements since this was our three-year anniversary. Upon check-in, I asked if the special arrangements (flowers arranged in a heart with our initials in the middle, red bull, a FULL bottle of vodka, and orange soda) were done. I was told that they were not sure if they were done and that if they weren’t, it would be complete during evening turn-down service. I had no problem with that as we had our spa appointment shortly after check in. Upon returning from the spa, there were no flowers and I found a bottle of tonic water and a SHOT of vodka. As we were leaving the hotel on our way to our anniversary dinner, I stopped by the front desk and respectfully communicated my dismay at the lack of professionalism towards accommodating personal requests for special occasions. I was offered either free drinks or free breakfast for my troubles and I said no as either did not work with our itinerary for our anniversary weekend. I was told that because I booked the hotel through a discount website I could not be refunded or comped even a portion of the cost of the stay. I was instead told that if I wanted to make things right, I could pay for another night and allow them to do it right. Since it was our anniversary and believing that the hotel management would make it right, I paid for another night (WHICH I NOW SEVERELY REGRET). After we returned from dinner, we found that the flowers were laid out. That only added insult to injury. Upon calling the hotel before returning to make sure that everything was in place, I was told that due to “security reasons” I could not be provided a full bottle of vodka (even though I was willing to pay for it) and was instead provided with two mini-bar bottles and instead of a 2-liter of orange soda I was given a personal bottle. I have stayed at many hotels for special occasions and this was the first hotel out of many to tell me I could not be provided a full bottle of alcohol. Since we decided to stay another night, we decided to try out their “club”. Before explaining how the manager made my wife cry, I would like to explain this. We are state employees and as such we are issued government IDs. When the manager examined her state ID (because she left her license at home by accident). He said “how do I know that this is not an employee ID” I showed him the holo-pad and her DOB. He then stated “How do I know this is not an issue date? (the ID does not specifically state that the date shown is her DOB) He then said “This ID is not acceptable. Goodbye”. He then walked off which is beyond unacceptable for hospitality management. I would understand refusal or not listening if we were at a liquor store, but we were guests at this hotel so it was completely uncalled for, for him to not even listen to us. I would also like to point out that HER ID WAS ACCEPTED AT TWO OTHER BARS THE SAME NIGHT. If the issue date was her DOB, one she’d be older than 21 and two, he insulted my wife by insinuating that she was nearly 30 years older than her age. She was so upset she cried nearly an hour after returning to the hotel room. What makes this even worse was, if he was that truly concerned, there is a 24-hour hotline (which is on the back of the ID) that can be called to confirm we are who we say we are. But of course, this manager was completely unprofessional and walked away before we could explain. This anniversary was nothing but a nightmare and the best part of the trip was being able to leave such a rude and unprofessional hotel. If I could give this hotel a 0, I would. Side note: I was TABC certified so I know what I am talking about. TABC allows establishments to choose which ID is or is not acceptable. However, we were not at a standalone bar (which we got into two of those before we came back to the hotel as stated earlier) we were at a HOTEL WHERE HOSPITALITY AND PROFESSIONALISM IS EXPECTED EVEN FROM MANAGEMENT. Had the manager been courteous and professional (INSTEAD OF CONFRONTATIONAL) when he denied us, it would not have been upsetting.",Couples,,Texas,Dance,Huntsville,NA,No,11/13,THIS HOTEL DESERVES A 0

(and no, we didn't have a privacy sign on the door) This meant no ice, no bottled water. I wasn't interested in calling down to request since it was so late. I mentioned it to the front desk the next morning and they didn't seem the least bit concerned, and asked if I wanted it that night (well of course I do, I wouldn't be bringing it up otherwise). Things like this shouldn't slip through the cracks at a hotel of this level. Other than that, the hotel is nice enough in all other areas. Great bar with live music on Saturday night. Towncar service to the Galleria was quick and easy. Certainly not the crown jewel of St Regis properties, but one of the nicer options in the Houston area.",Couples,,Louisiana,Dance,Shreveport,F,No,08/14,"A nice option for a weekend in Houston, but......"

Checkout time is noon, I asked if there's any availability could I have something potentially later without an extra cost and he was able to push my time back a some. I was greatly appreciative for him doing that; I had literally been up for over 24 hours at that point. It was 2 o'clock in the morning when I checked in and I never felt my safety compromised. I chose self parking at $14 a day and the lot was very secure. You swipe your room key and a actual gate plus control arm opened and allows you to enter. Upon entering my room, it had a very fresh smell and everything was in place. The sheets had not a wrinkle and were about as tight as military standards; I could probably bounce a quarter on them. The white linens, towels and comforter were bright and not faded. I had a room on the 18th floor facing a skyline of downtown Houston, the view was amazing. The room is elegant with modern features. On the 18th floor there was also a gym and pool, both having full views of the sky line. In summary, I would highly recommend this hotel. Anytime I return to Houston in the future, this will be one of the first places I look at while booking.",Solo,4,NA,Dance,,NA,Yes,02/16,Amazing Hotel

The first night I had to literally ask the valet if they were going to valet my car, and the scecond night, the valet person again didn't look up when I pulled up bc he was busy on his phone AND he parked my car without a valet sticker and I got one of those horrible ""hard to get off the window"" parked in the wrong spot stickers. Luckily the valet guys in the morning were bettre and they actually worked to get the sticker off which I really appreciated, and redeemed my valet experience.

Overall, it was a very good night stay. I didn't use any of the amenities so I can't comment about that. Location - there is a lot within a short driving distance but not much around it. Fyi, It looks like they are building some other Hotels and/or Apartment buildings right around the corner. Thus, during my stay, there was a lot of construction nearby which wasn't the most appealing. Overall location, below average rating for places within walking distance but above average rating for places nearby, if you don't mind driving a a couple of miles. Front desk/checkin - it was very quick. They had my keys ready and had me on my way in a minute or two. But, it wasn't the most inviting reception. I got a hi, may I have your ID/credit card, and here are your keys. That was about it. Usually they at least go over the amenities or give you a little more information about the hotel. I wasn't even told how to get to the room. Odd. Amenities - I didn't use any of them. I did see a bar and a little restaurant by the front desk as well as a small outdoor pool on the side of the hotel. Room - it was quite spacious but felt the decor was a little outdated. It had a microwave and refrigerator which was useful. The bed seemed a little hard but still comfy (of course beds are all subjective). I did hear some noise but wasn't sure where it came from. Maybe the hallway or maybe someone next door? By about 9/10pm it got pretty quiet. The a/c was cool but annoyed me when it was turned on. It was blowing the drapes open and letting light in which was particularly annoying at 6 in the morning! The bathroom was big but some reason I was given a handicap accessible room.
