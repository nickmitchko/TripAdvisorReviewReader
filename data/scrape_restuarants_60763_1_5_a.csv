The bar area is spacious and they have TV's everywhere so it's a bit of a sports bar accent on what is otherwise a typical NYC bar/Irish Bar type place. The menu is good for the bar food, burgers, etc. They seem to try to put some fancier dishes on the menu to be some kind of gastropub or something more than a bar and grill, but I don't know how those foods are. I'm very happy with the burgers, wings, and other bar foods. It is not a cheap place but I wouldn't say it's expensive... reasonable prices. The staff are courteous (and seems they are all attractive, don't know if it's by design or coincidence, but OK with me) and the service can be mediocre but usually is above average; it's never been bad service for me here. Bottom line, I don't go out of my way to eat here usually, but on occasion I choose it; I would say you can't go wrong here but it won't be anything exceptional or much different from other pub/restaurants in the area.

In fact, I really think Google maps should not list them as a steakhouse when I search for steakhouse. You come in, bar is small and tightly spaced. First thing you'll notice are the bartenders and you wonder if you're in a strip club. Don't worry, they're skimpily clothed. Should be a plus if you're a guy, right? Probably. Unfortunately, if you want to eat at the bar this is a very bad thing. They're basically their to flirt and keep customers, mainly Wall St types drinking. They were so busy talking that I cannot order for at least a good 20 minutes. When one of them finally come around actually working, she did not really understand English and spoke in a heavy European accent. I say I wanted the surf and turf which is one of their specialties and she was like we had that? Then she tried to find it in the menu. I also told her if I can get the steak first and then the lobster. I always find one of them cold when served together and she said sure. The food took forever to come while the bartenders just continue working, oh I mean talking to customers. Now I know the importance of being friendly and light chit chat to establish good relationship with clientele but this is extreme. Theses women are basically doing nothing but talking. I'm thinking my food is ready and they don't even know. Finally someone brought the food to the bar but he did not know who it's for so left it at the inner bar counter. Sure enough, it was just sitting there and not served to me because these bartending women are still busy chatting with customers. I tried to tell them, but too loud in here and to no avail. When finally they realized that the food was behind them, it was cold. And what's this? Why is the lobster there? I was like I wanted the lobster afterwards and so she took the lobster and place it on another plate and place it behind her on the counter and then continue chatting again. Wow, just wow. Normally, you should send this back but not really my style. I quickly finished my cold steak which might've been good, who knows...if it was hot. Then asked if I could get the cold lobster at the counter behind her and then proceed to finish that as fast as I can. Of course, it took another 20 minutes to get the check. She's now sharing her pictures with another customer...wow, just wow. The customer was like this guy just ordered a steak and lobster, you should show him your pictures. I smiled and said no thank you and she gave a disgusted look and said fine, I don't want to show them to you anyway. What I really wanted to say is no, I don't want to look at your stinking pictures, just the check please which I asked for like 20 minutes ago.

The fabulous bread served with a dish of olive oil and olives started us off. The bread is incredible and made in house. We then shared the mixed cold appetizers (15.95) and one was better than the other. The yogurt dip was creamy with a perfect touch of tartness and composed of cucumbers, garlic, and mint. The home made stuffed grape leaves were delicious and very well flavored. We loved them. My husband does not ordinarily like babaganush but said this was the best he ever had, and I agree; it had a slight smoky flavor and a nice balance of garlic and tahini. Great hummus and a mixture of tomatoes, green and red peppers with onions and parsley dressed with oil and vinegar rounded out the platter. The only improvement would be to let everything come to room temperature before serving. At first it was a little too cold as it must have come straight from the fridge but as it warmed up the flavors really came alive. I realize the need for refrigeration but the cold temperature does take away from the unique and delicate seasoning of each dish. The appetizers were so filling that we split a main course of chicken adana and lamb kabob plate (18.95). The chicken was out of this world and the lamb was delicious as well but if we knew how really good that chicken was we would have ordered only that. You can have lamb anywhere but that ground chicken so perfectly seasoned is alone worth the trip to this restaurant. The dish came with a rice pilaf, grilled veggies and a salad. We were stuffed. The chef gave us a complimentary rice pudding, which was a very nice gesture and much appreciated. We never had Turkish wine before so we each ordered a glass of Yakut. It’s a nice dry, but non-acidic red that was very good and we are now on the hunt to find a few bottles. Overall we had a wonderful dinner and would definitely recommend this place.

It’s an intimate space which captures the feel and the flavors of a great trattoria-style restaurant. The menu is small, but includes a nice variety of options and periodically-changing specials; I often carb-splurge on one of their excellent housemade pasta dishes, but one can enjoy a completely satisfying meal without ingesting so much as a breadcrumb. Excellent salads and cold meat and cheese appetizer and antipasti options, and the rosemary roasted chicken and the grilled pork chop are both delicious if you’re not feeling like pasta. If pasta is on your menu, the black squid ink linguini is one of the best versions I’ve ever tasted, and the gnocchi are little mouth-pillows of delight. I can’t recommend the crostini highly enough; I would list our favorites, but that would include pretty much every option (okay, the wild mushroom and the liver pâté are both spectacular!). Delectable desserts; the poached pear with housemade fig gelato is heaven on a plate. Decent wines (glass wines can be uneven) and a well-equipped full bar; they also have daily happy hour specials (in the bar area only), which are delicious and extra affordable. The prices are surprisingly below New York standard, particularly for the quality of the food. We chanced upon Saggio the night we closed on our apartment nearby, and now often use it as a destination for special celebrations. In nearly two years of regular dining, it has never disappointed.

So often, hotel venues are an attempt at having a middle-of-the-road eatery with a captive resident audience, but this place is done very well indeed! It's a proper bar and grill, without feeling even remotely that it's part of a hotel. I had a la carte breakfast here while staying at the Hilton, as breakfast wasn't part of my package, and the selections were excellent and tasty. It's typical breakfast fare, but done with a touch of class that you'd expect of a restaurant that's a bar and grill. I also managed to check out the roof top bar, which was pretty cool. The views were good (though it was cloudy during my stay, so the view of the Empire State Building was pretty well hidden!), but the beer selection was a bit mundane, with just the usual mass-produced offerings available.
